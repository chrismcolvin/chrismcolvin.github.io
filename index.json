[{"content":"My wife and I moved to West Michigan in 2015, and I quickly learned about the plentiful and beautiful locations to hike and spend time in nature. One of these places is a little park just a short hop north of town. And in that park is a tree.\nI always found myself drawn to this tree for its unique form and old, weathered appearance. It‚Äôs just off the path near a bridge, under which winds a small stream. It‚Äôs a wonderful little moment, and always worth a few minutes of my time to observe, breathe, and ponder.\nBut this year, on my first hike along that path in quite a while, I found that the tree had become bent and broken, bowing down towards the ground. But, even in this state, the tree is still beautiful.\nThese two photographs were taken about a year about.\n","date":"September 29 2022","permalink":"/posts/old-friend/","section":"Posts","summary":"My wife and I moved to West Michigan in 2015, and I quickly learned about the plentiful and beautiful locations to hike and spend time in nature.","title":"Old Friend"},{"content":"At this point, I think we‚Äôve all‚Äîthose of us in the web development or web design world, at least‚Äîheard of a little thing called FlexBox. If you‚Äôve been hiding under a rock, however, FlexBox is a new(ish) way to create layouts in CSS.\nToday I‚Äôm going to share some things I‚Äôve learned about FlexBox since it has become usable in all mainstream and evergreen browsers.\n1. FlexBox isn‚Äôt a one stop fix #\rNeed some columns? Use FlexBox. Need to center something? Use FlexBox. Need to make two columns the same height? Use FlexBox. Truly, FlexBox can be used for so many things today that used to require sloppy CSS or even JavaScript.\nBut that doesn‚Äôt mean that you can use it for everything, or that it solves every problem. Even with the high level of awesome that FlexBox is, it just won‚Äôt always do what you need to do.\nJust be prepared to use other tools if needed. Grid can be very useful and, yes, I even still use floats sometimes!\n2. You can use FlexBox and Grid together #\rFlexBox and Grid are not the same thing. They share a few similarities and can often be used to accomplish the same goals, but there are occasions where you may want to use both. And you should feel just fine doing so!\nThey are both great tools, so use whichever one serves your specific needs best, even if that‚Äôs both at the same time.\n3. (Still) use AutoPrefixer #\rFlexBox (and Grid) has great support in evergreen browsers. So great that at this point, there‚Äôs really no point in not using it.\nBut that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt use prefixes. I‚Äôd still recommend them for FlexBox, and running your code through an AutoPrefixer is pretty simple. Chances are you‚Äôll catch some other styles that needed it anyways.\n4. You‚Äôll still need to do some maths #\rWant five columns in that row? Cool! FlexBox can do that! Want each column to be a specific width? Awesome! FlexBox can do that! Want gaps between those columns! Cool‚Ä¶ But let‚Äôs not get too‚Ä¶ Oh, you want to get crazy with the margins and paddings and‚Ä¶\nOkay, so in a perfect project you‚Äôll be able to plan things out in a way where no math is going to be necessary on your end. But let‚Äôs be honest, most projects aren‚Äôt perfect. Or, if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre frequently working on sites you didn‚Äôt develop or sites that were built before FlexBox was viable.\nIn these cases, you may still have to pull out the old calculator.\n5. You don‚Äôt have to use it! #\rMost developers today would say that you‚Äôre insane not to use FlexBox, and I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm one of them! But I also don‚Äôt really care if you don‚Äôt. As a WordPress Developer, I‚Äôve seen a vast array of styling techniques and, despite the popularity of newer techniques, the old ones usually still work.\nConclusion #\rIn the end, FlexBox is just another tool in the shed. How, when, and why you use it don‚Äôt really matter if the end product is there. Just be mindful of what your needs actually are and to ensure that your code is readable and easy to maintain. The rest is icing on the cake.\nBesides, who doesn‚Äôt love doing some layouts in tables once in a while (just kidding).\n","date":"September 21 2022","permalink":"/posts/flexbox/","section":"Posts","summary":"At this point, I think we‚Äôve all‚Äîthose of us in the web development or web design world, at least‚Äîheard of a little thing called FlexBox.","title":"5 Things I‚Äôve Learned About FlexBox"},{"content":"I haven\u0026rsquo;t been on a hike in an embarrassingly long time. The motivation just hasn\u0026rsquo;t been there for a while. But, after a recent injury and a bout of COVID-19, I began to miss being outdoors and taking photos. So, here a just a small handful of shots from a recent hike at Seidman Park. It was a short and sweet hike, but overall a productive one.\nThis last one isn\u0026rsquo;t from that hike, but I wanted to share it anyways.

Half way through 2022, already! The past few years have actually felt a bit slower than normal to me, but 2022 seems to be flying by. Perhaps a relatively new job, an ever-persistent pandemic (well, sort of), and life changes have made the past few months feel a little short.\nWhatever the reason, I was recently brainstorming ways to help myself reflect more on everything that\u0026rsquo;s going on and it seemed like a great chance to start posting to my blog more often. I don\u0026rsquo;t often get big ideas for blog posts, so I thought short, simple life updates could be fun, and help me spend some time thinking about what life\u0026rsquo;s been like.\nThat said, let\u0026rsquo;s get the tough update out of the way.\nA sad thing #\rJess and I, after months of debate and unsurety, made the difficult decision to re-home our dog, Luna. This actually happened late in June, but it\u0026rsquo;s still fresh on our minds and the impacts are still being felt every day. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to get into the specifics of why we made the decision, but I will say that it was extremely difficult, and that it will take more than a few weeks to stop missing her.\nA relatively recent picture of Luna\nNow, hopefully the rest of my updates aren\u0026rsquo;t such sad ones üòî\nDevelopment goals #\rAs with many jobs my current role, now that it\u0026rsquo;s been over a year, can sometimes feel a bit stagnant. That\u0026rsquo;s just the nature of jobs like mine, you do very similar work day-to-day, and it can often feel like you\u0026rsquo;re solving the same problems over and over again, or building the same UI again and again (but with different colors!). So, in an effort to change things up and keep myself excited about what I do, I have decided to learn something new.\nSince it\u0026rsquo;s been on my \u0026lsquo;Want to learn\u0026rsquo; list for a while, what better time to learn React.js! ‚öõ I\u0026rsquo;ll be using Codecademy\u0026rsquo;s Learn React course to get started, and hope to at least build a couple of small apps to really get the hang of things. Maybe a game? We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nSwitching to Linux üêß #\rLinux is really cool, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to be giving it a more serious effort than in years past. With Valve putting tons of effort and resources into the Steam Deck and Proton, gaming on Linux has come a long way. And, of course, each new version of any popular GNU/Linux distribution brings with it cool new features while closing the gap between what Windows or macOS can do and what Linux can do. The fact that Linux has always been more friendly to developers was the main reason I got interested in Linux in the first place, but now it could truly put up a fight to become my daily driver. So, about a month ago, I decided to switch to Linux on both my laptop and my desktop.\nLaptop vs. desktop #\rSwitching on the laptop has been super easy. I chose Pop!_OS and installing it on my Thinkpad was a breeze. The only hardware related thing I needed to get working was the fingerprint sensor, which was fairly simple to do. Pop runs great on it, and for my relatively simple use cases, Linux can do everything I need and so much more.\nI have also been utilizing Pop!_OS on my desktop, but the results have been mixed. For the most part everything worked without a hitch, but gaming still isn\u0026rsquo;t quite there, in my opinion. That said, is it good enough? For me, yes. Of course, there are games or software that simply won\u0026rsquo;t run without causing headaches on Linux, so I have had to keep my expectations in check.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t at least tried Linux in some form, but have been either curious or just don\u0026rsquo;t like Windows, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend doing some research (I really can\u0026rsquo;t stress how important research is here) and then giving it a try. It\u0026rsquo;s very fun, rewarding, and I think you\u0026rsquo;d be surprised at how much more it can offer than Windows.\nThere may be future posts about Linux here. If that\u0026rsquo;s something you might be interested in, check back once in a while.\nThe beauty of post-apocalyptic Boston #\rI recently started a new play-through of Fallout 4, in which you explore a post-apocalyptic Boston in search of your lost son, and I forgot how beautiful the broken, decaying, harsh world of that game can be. It\u0026rsquo;s a heck of a lot of fun, and the graphics hold up very well.\nOne thing I\u0026rsquo;ve always really appreciated about Bethesda\u0026rsquo;s games is that they really suck you in to the world that they\u0026rsquo;ve built. The combat is usually a bit clunky, the characters often feel a little robotic or downright stupid, and the voice acting has, in my opinion, always been a bit lackluster. But these things bring with them their own unique charm. What\u0026rsquo;s amazing about these games is that, despite these shortcomings, there is a real sense of being a part of a greater whole\u0026hellip; That your actions, interactions, and decisions don\u0026rsquo;t just matter, but subtly fit themselves in to the greater story. You often feel insignificant, but you shape the world immensely.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s pretty beautiful.\n","date":"August 1 2022","permalink":"/posts/july-2022/","section":"Posts","summary":"Wow!

Spend a few hours listening to a few great podcasts and the reason for this becomes quite clear: podcasts are an amazing and simple way of hearing awesome stories, catching up on industry news, or exploring a new hobby. The amount of entertainment and information within the podcastsphere is seemingly endless‚Ä¶ And that can be a bit intimidating.\nWith thousands of fantastic podcasts to choose from made by a huge variety of talented people with something to share, it can be difficult to know where to begin. My advice is always to first consider what you might want in a podcast and then search around for what people are recommending in that category. Looking for top notch storytelling with a spooky twist? Search for horror podcasts. Looking for deep dives into current events? There are plenty of podcasts that cover the news from a variety of perspectives. Want to learn more about gardening? A quick search in Overcast comes up with dozens. The important idea here is that with so many out there, part of the fun is exploring the different ideas and genres out there and finding the podcasts you really enjoy.\nWith that, I wanted to share the ten podcasts I am most looking forward to listening to more of in 2021. Podcasts I listen to fall into a range of topics and categories, and my top ten are no different. Note that these are my top ten podcasts, and my interests may not align with yours, but I hope you find something here that piques your interest.\nAlong with a short bit about each podcast and why I like them, I‚Äôve also included whether or not I think they require listening from the first episode. I have put each pick into one of the following categories:\nNo: Jump right in! No episodes really require hearing another to start enjoying the podcast. Of course, feel free to scroll through the backlogs and listen to episodes that look interesting.\nMaybe: It depends. These podcasts might have several episodes that build off of each other, or include many different multi-episode stories. You‚Äôll want to at least glance at the backlog to make sure you‚Äôre not missing out on anything interesting or important, and if the most recent episode is part of a series, go back and start from the beginning of that series. But, if you don‚Äôt care or don‚Äôt have the patience, you can also just listen to the latest episode and not feel too lost.\nYes: You will definitely want to start from episode one with these. What happens in episode 23 will likely be confusing or uninteresting without everything that came before it. These are likely story-driven podcasts more akin to listening to an audio book than reading an article in a magazine.\n10. Bananas #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nKurt Braunohler and Scotty Landes discuss the strange, fascinating, and just plain bananas news from around the world.\nThis is a podcast in which you truly never know what you are going to hear. Kurt and Scotty pull unexpected news from any and all sources ranging from the time a criminal tried to escape being caught using an underwater sea scooter to a man dressed as a cow stealing milk from Walmart. It can be a wild ride that may simultaneously be fascinating, hilarious, and horrifying. This podcast often features guests who are invited to come along for the ride.\nIf you think you‚Äôd enjoy a podcast that pokes fun at the extraordinary, but lesser-known, events happening every day, then this is a great place to start.\n9. The Candid Frame #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nEach week host Ibarionex Parello brings in-depth, intimate and thoughtful conversations with photographers on living a photographic life.\nIf you are at all interested in photography, let the deep, soothing voice of Ibarionex guide you through conversations with some of the worlds best photographers. Starring amazing guests from portrait photographers that shoot the worlds biggest celebrities to world-renowned fine art and landscape photographers, there is no shortage of amazing conversation and story in this podcast.\nIn The Candid Frame, Ibarionex gets personal with his guests, delving into their stories, backgrounds, and philosophies. While respectful, he challenges them to discuss the tougher aspects of their lives, art, or careers, often revealing the more human aspects of these fantastic artists you don‚Äôt see or hear day-to-day.\nIf you‚Äôve ever wondered what some of the best photographers of today are really like or how they got to where they are, this is the podcast for you.\nOh yeah, and did I mention his voice?\n8. Supernatural With Ashley Flowers #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nMost mysteries can be solved by looking at the facts. But sometimes, the facts don‚Äôt lead to a logical explanation, and the truth lies somewhere in the unknown‚Ä¶\nIf you already have some experience with podcasts you may know about a podcast called Criminal. If not, Criminal, hosted by Phoebe Judge, is a true crime podcast in which Phoebe explores real crimes and often interviews those involved with the crime or with the criminals. It‚Äôs a fascinating look into real-world events which often seem more likely to have occurred in a TV show or fiction. It was also very close to making this list and is well-worth a listen.\nSupernatural is to unexplained events as Criminal is to true crime.\nIn each episode, Ashley Flowers explores an unexplained mystery you may, or may not, have heard of. Taking a deep-dive into the people and events surrounding these mysteries, Ashley unravels the stories and theories, attempting to reveal what really happened. Often, this only leads to more questions. The result is a podcast that is simultaneously exciting and unsettling.\nThis podcast offers a great introduction to the supernatural and/or true crime genres, and is a good place to start if you‚Äôre not sure whether or not you‚Äôll like them.\n7. Sawbones: A Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nJoin Dr. Sydnee McElroy and her husband Justin McElroy for a tour of all the dumb, bad, gross, weird, and wrong ways we‚Äôve tried to fix people.\nEver wonder what the miracle elixirs of yesteryear really were and how they came to be, or about the medical virtues of coffee, or maybe the how fluoride became both savior and villain at the same time? Dr. Sydnee and Justin explore topics like these and so much more in Sawbones. This is a podcast that I truly always look forward to, as the conversation is always either relevant to current events or just very interesting.\nDr. Sydnee brings the expertise while Justin brings the humor (anyone who has listened to the ever-popular My Brother My Brother and Me will know the name). The couple brings a fantastic, and often hilarious, dynamic to all sorts of medical-related topics. Surely this must be one of the only podcasts to combine this level of historical medical research with this kind of humor. If you know of another please let me know!\n6. Lore #\rListen from episode one? Maybe.\nFind it here.\nLore is a bi-weekly podcast about dark historical tales.\nThis is one of those podcasts I have been listening to since I started listening to podcasts years ago. Note that while this could be labeled No for listening from episode one, there are so many exceptional episodes in the backlog that I labeled it Maybe instead. Just know that if you don‚Äôt listen to past episodes, you‚Äôll do just fine.\nIf you like stories about the supernatural and disconcerting experiences of real-life people throughout history, look no further than Lore. Host Aaron Mahnke has the unique ability to instill within the listener an uneasy doubt about their own realities. He doesn‚Äôt attempt to explain away the experiences of the characters in the stories he shares, but rather uses them as a platform to explore the human psyche and the often devastating effects it can have on our realities. If you only have one slot for a podcast in this genre, this could be the one to fill it.\nBefore jumping into his latest episodes, I highly recommend listening to episode 23: Rope and Railing. While the production was a bit dry back then, this episode has some fascinating exploration around lighthouses and the symbolism and mystery they can hold in our lives. It also serves as a great introduction to the type of content you can expect from Aaron.\n5. The Wild with Chris Morgan #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nTHE WILD with Chris Morgan explores how nature survives and thrives alongside (and often despite) humans.\nFrom bears to birds to serene soundscapes, this podcast encourages the listener to slip away into the great outdoors through audio. In it, Chris tells amazing stories from the wilder parts of the Pacific Northwest. Though the episodes are rarely very long, they always provide a nice break from the realities of day-to-day life.\nNot all episodes are strictly about wildlife‚Ä¶ Or rather, some do involve humans. Chris will frequently bring the listener along on his travels to meet men and women who, like himself, have been drawn to the outdoors. Whether that be to see a rare bird or track endangered species, these are people that love the wild.\nIf you are a lover of the outdoors, or are just looking for a mental break from the busyness of life, this is a fantastic listen.\n4. My Brother My Brother and Me #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nAn advice podcast for the modren era. The McElroy brothers are here to take your questions and turn them, alchemy-like, into wisdom.\nIf that description sounds a little goofy to you, that‚Äôs because it is.\nReal-life brothers: Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy are a truly dynamic trio that can‚Äôt really seem to take anything seriously‚Ä¶ And that‚Äôs a great thing, ‚Äòcus it‚Äôs a comedy podcast!\nThe premise of this show is pretty simple: three brothers read questions found on Yahoo Answers and try to answer them. They do not, however, try to answer them in any sort of helpful manner, often giving advice that could be described as the opposite of helpful.The result is usually hilarious. I have, on more than one occasion, accidentally laughed out loud in the office listening to this podcast.\nNow, there are many many comedy podcasts, so you would be forgiven for wondering why this podcast from three random brothers might have a place this high on my list when several better-known comedians have their own. That is because they have built a platform that relates so well with us internet folk. More than just telling some good jokes, their whit and character has helped these three boys become some of the most beloved characters in the medium and even the internet, largely because of their ability to just think outside the box.\nSeriously, give them a shot. Though, note that the humor can be pretty crude, so sorry if that‚Äôs not your thing.\n3. Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies #\rListen from episode one? Yes.\nFind it here.\nDungeons and Daddies is an award-winning Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons podcast that started in January, 2019.\nDo you like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, or like the idea of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons? Do you have the sense of humor of a child? Do you love creative and unexpected storytelling? Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies fits all of these characteristics and more.\nWithout giving too much away, Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies takes the idea of a traditional Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons podcast and adds an odd twist: the main characters are all dads from the modern world. I know, not the most riveting premise, and I‚Äôll admit I was hesitant. But, this has quickly become one of my favorites of the D\u0026amp;D podcasts I have tried, and it‚Äôs one of the few I‚Äôm sticking with for 2021/. The characters are unique and quirky, the story is compelling, and the whole show is extremely entertaining.\nIf you find that you like this genre, other D\u0026amp;D podcasts worth listening to:\nAdventure Zone\nSneak Attack Critical RoleTotal Party Kill\n2. Fruitloops: Serial Killers of Color #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nFruitloops is a weekly podcast hosted by Wendy and Beth. We are two female true crime enthusiasts who aim to bring you the often-untold stories of crimes committed by serial killers of color.\nTrue crime podcasts really took off over the last couple of years, and while some of the classics are still around, like Criminal or My Favorite Murder, there are new up-and-comers all the time. Fruitloops is a new(ish) podcast all about serial killers of color.\nWendy and Beth were fans of true crime, but they noticed that mainstream media has largely historically ignored serial killers that weren‚Äôt white. In response to this, they started a podcast where they focus on diverse crime stories you probably haven‚Äôt heard before.\nAlongside these stories, Wendy and Beth frequently have conversations around race, personal safety, and current events. The two have a great dynamic that keeps the podcast both entertaining and informative.\nFair warning: true crime podcasts can get morbid.\n1. Dan Carlin‚Äôs Hardcore History #\rListen from episode one? Maybe.\nFind it here.\nHow did a multi-hour long show that consists of nothing more than a host talking about history ever become wildly popular? It‚Äôs got something to do with Dan Carlin.\nThe title really (almost) says it all. Dan Carlin talks about historical events in great detail.\nBut that really doesn‚Äôt do it justice.\nTopics tend to center in on a specific scope of history. For example: in the first episode of his series Blueprint for Armageddon, Dan focuses in on the largely unknown literal and figurative trigger that led to World War I. He then, over the course of several multi-hour (often three or four hour) long episodes, explores the entire chain of events that follow. From the difficult political games world leaders are forced into, to journal entries from those in the field of history‚Äôs most horrific battlefields, Carlin focuses on the extremes of the human experience, and the wonder of how tiny decisions in the grand scheme of time can have long, widespread, and often devastating consequences.\nThere is a weight to the stories, when Dan tells them, that you don‚Äôt get in history textbooks.\nIf you are at all interested in history, the intricate balancing act of politics, or the amazing impact single individuals can have on the world, then Dan Carlin‚Äôs Hardcore History is one of the most rewarding podcasts you can listen to.\nQuick note: only some of the most recent series are available for free in regular podcast players, but if you find that you enjoy his content the archived series are well worth the cost. In fact, I have paid for some to listen again.\nI hope you explore some of these and find some joy in them.\nDo you have a top ten or fifteen or twenty podcasts you are looking forward to most in 2021? Let me know! I‚Äôm always looking for more.\n","date":"January 22 2021","permalink":"/posts/top-podcasts-2021/","section":"Posts","summary":"My Top Ten Podcasts for 2021 #\rPodcasts have exploded in the last few years, and I have no doubt that 2021 will see that trend continue.","title":"Top Podcasts 2021"},{"content":"Why I got into photography #\rOf all the artistic mediums that I‚Äôve tried, only one has stuck with me as something that I truly love: photography. I love photography. I also have an immense appreciation for film. And now, I‚Äôm going to delve into why that is, and maybe it will spark an interest in someone new!\nI first got into photography in high-school. Like many things in my life, I got the idea to try out photography from my older brother. I often followed my brother‚Äôs footsteps, though I‚Äôve never excelled at any one thing quite as well as he had. Ah, well, that is something I can live with, because so many of these things have brought me so much joy and satisfaction. I picked up a few hobbies due to my brother: percussion, BMX, my early preferences in music, the Zelda series, the list goes on‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt think any of them have stuck with me quite as much as photography has.\n‚ÄúIt is difficult to pick up my camera to shoot a scene and not think of that.\nThis puts a lot of personal and nostalgic weight on the medium for me. It‚Äôs something that I attribute to my past and to my relationship with my brother. It is difficult to pick up my camera to shoot a scene and not think of that. It‚Äôs small but it‚Äôs one aspect of the medium that‚Äôs continued to draw me back.\nBeing creative #\rIt‚Äôs also one of the few mediums I‚Äôve gotten to be half-way decent at, and one that didn‚Äôt require hours upon hours of physically and emotionally draining work to feel confident at (percussion or drawing can certainly have their moments). I always wanted to be creative-I wanted to be an artist as a child-and photography is a creative outlet that has clicked with me and doesn‚Äôt require putting in the hours of a second job.\nPhotography and philosophy #\rThe idea of photography is also utterly fascinating to me. No other medium lets us snatch up a moment of reality, of time, and preserve it like photography does. There is a lot of power in that. In my junior year, I wrote a response to Susan Sontag‚Äôs On Photography, a fabulous exploration of the meaning and potential consequences of photography, and its increasing accessibility over time. If you‚Äôd like to read my response, it can be found here. I recommend reading the book first, however.\n‚ÄúThis way of quickly and easily documenting time and reality is incredible and unprecedented‚Ä¶\nOne more reason I am fascinated by photography is that it, like many creative mediums, is consequential. It is meaningful. And it is these things without having to be ‚Äúgood.‚Äù An image holds a lot of weight, even if it is just a snap that you‚Äôve thrown on to Facebook. You have literally captured a moment of time and archived it. You‚Äôve preserved your perspective of something and shown it to all else to see as you‚Äôve seen it. It is incredibly intimate and can quickly be seen as invasive. This way of quickly and easily documenting time and reality is incredible and unprecedented in the majority of human history.\nSo that‚Äôs a bit about why I love photography so much, but why film? What is it about that old, outdated model of taking photos that appeals to me?\nBut why film? #\rThe main answer you‚Äôd probably hear to that question is that film has a certain amount of nostalgia to it. The photos just ooze 1970‚Äôs. This is certainly true, but I think it‚Äôs more than that.\nNostalgia\u0026hellip; But more? #\rI grew up around film, and yet my first few years of taking photos were all digital. Film is interesting to me partially because it‚Äôs a bit foreign. It‚Äôs kind of new, and it seems it‚Äôs taking longer for it to lose that feel.\nNow, because I grew up around film, there is a bit of nostalgia around it. But it‚Äôs not usually the images that create that for me, it‚Äôs the film itself. I would often go with my mother to drop off or pick up the film from the last few weeks of photos. It was a fun experience, and I guess it still is (though, I go on my own and take my own photos these days).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tangible #\rAnother reason I like film is due to its tangibility. It‚Äôs nice to load and unload the film. It‚Äôs fun to look at the little images on the negatives you get back from the lab. The cameras are more of an experience to use, too. My Canon AE-1 requires shooting in manual. Its body is metal, the mechanics are heavy and audible. The sound of that shutter, or the film advancing, is so satisfying! You could make an argument that using a ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù digital, camera will allow you to take better photographs by removing itself from between you and your subject. Its strength is largely in its ease of use. However, there‚Äôs something so much more substantial about using something a little chunky, a little cumbersome.\nSlowing down #\rOne more aspect of shooting film that digital can‚Äôt provide is time. Between loading a roll of film, shooting it (you should be taking your time with your shots, as you have far fewer with film), unloading it, and finally, developing it, there‚Äôs a lot of time that goes into far fewer shots. There‚Äôs something nice about that. Slowing down a bit. Focusing on what you‚Äôre doing to make sure your exposures are good and your image is in focus. The anticipation when waiting to get your film back from the lab. It all adds up to a much more interesting and exciting experience.\n‚ÄúTime, cost, sometimes frustration, these all mean I am more intentional about taking photos‚Ä¶\nSummary #\rTo sum up all those things into one overall reason that I love film: it is intentional. Time, cost, sometimes frustration, these all mean I am more intentional abut taking photos. It makes me slow down and think about what I‚Äôm doing, and I really like that. I have to do most things fast. I‚Äôm always trying to be more productive, more efficient, but film helps me get away from the hectic tendencies of day-to-day life. That‚Äôs part of why I‚Äôve started using fountain pens, started writing by hand again, ride my bike more (when I‚Äôm not being lazy), etc. As the number of things I need to do each day goes up, I have to find joy and peace in doing those things. Film let‚Äôs me enjoy taking photos just a bit more.\nAnyways, I love photography. I love film. And I love sharing those things. Do you have anything that you love that might seem impractical? Do you love something, are fascinated by something? I hope so. It makes life just that much more enjoyable.\n","date":"June 7 2018","permalink":"/posts/film-photography/","section":"Posts","summary":"Why I got into photography #\rOf all the artistic mediums that I‚Äôve tried, only one has stuck with me as something that I truly love: photography.","title":"Film Photography"},{"content":"Part 2: Installing Hugo #\rIntro #\rAlright, so you‚Äôre excited about creating your new website and you‚Äôre excited to give Hugo a try. Fair enough! Let‚Äôs jump right into it!\nA couple things to note, though, before we get started. If you are looking for the simplest and quickest way to get Hugo up and running, look no further than Hugo‚Äôs own docs. They are fairly easy to read, and are great if you‚Äôre just looking to get into it as quickly as possible. For me, quick start guide only got me so far, left me with a lot of questions, and didn‚Äôt actually work. My goal here is flesh out some of those questions, as well as provides answers for some of the issues I ran into, just in case someone else does.\nIt‚Äôs also worth noting that while I work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, I‚Äôve only used Hugo on Linux, so that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll see here. If you‚Äôve got another OS, things shouldn‚Äôt be too different (depending on what you‚Äôve got installed), and Google should be able to get you to where you need to go.\nInstallation #\rInstallation with Hugo is (mostly) a breeze. Following the instructions on their quick start guide seems to work pretty well, with one caviat that I found-more on that later.\nThe terminal #\rTo start off, open your terminal/console of choice. I use the built-in terminal that comes with Ubuntu, my Linux flavor of choice. Using the built-in terminal on macOS should work just as well, though I believe you need Homebrew installed. Windows users will want to follow the steps mentioned here. Once you‚Äôre in your console, make sure that you‚Äôre not in the wrong folder by typing:\n~$ cd\rNow, on Linux all you have to do is type:\n~$ sudo apt-get install hugo\rThis should do it for Ubuntu/Debian users. Go ahead and follow the instructions in their docs if you‚Äôre using a different operating system.\nOnce complete, go ahead and type: hugo version to double check that the installation worked. It should show something like this:\nThe version problem #\rOne of the issues I ran into with Hugo was with installation. Or rather, it was with installing a theme. That in itself is an easy enough task, but if you look at a theme here, you‚Äôll see that on the left-hand side, it shows a minimum Hugo version. This is the minimum version of Hugo that you need installed in order to use that particular theme.\nThat‚Äôs all well and good, but installing Hugo by following the instructions in their docs should install the latest stable version, so that any theme can be used, right? Wrong. When I installed Hugo using the apt-get command, it installed version 0.16, or something like that. This only allowed me to use a small handful of themes, and there is no way to sort them by minimum version support.\nAfter some digging, I found that you can manually install the latest and greatest Hugo version by using the appropriate link from this page. This is pretty typical for installing stored on GitHub, but as someone who is fairly new to all of this, it was a bit confusing and frustrating.\nTo do this (again, on Ubuntu Linux), simply right-click the appropriate link, in my case the one that ends with Linux_64bit.deb, and put the following in a fresh console:\n~$ sudo wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.37.1/hugo_0.37.1_Linux-64bit.deb\rObviously replace that long url with the one you just copied. By the way, if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre probably wondering how to paste something into a terminal. Well, usually it‚Äôs ctrl+shift+v. Now that we‚Äôve downloaded the newest release of Hugo, let‚Äôs unpack it using the following:\n~$ sudo dpkg -i hugo*.deb\rNow, running hugo version should return the version number that you just installed.\nIf you‚Äôre still not seeing the right version of Hugo, I recommend turning to the good people of the internet to help solve the issue, but if you‚Äôre on Linux, and you followed all the above steps, you shouldn‚Äôt really have any issues.\nCreating your site #\rNow it‚Äôs time to create your site. With Hugo, this is very, very easy. It actually only takes a single command. But before we do that, let‚Äôs make sure you‚Äôre putting that site where you want it!\nFolder structure #\rCreate a folder where you want the site to be either in a finder/explorer window, or in your console. Either way, you‚Äôll need to navigate to that folder in your console, so I find it‚Äôs easier to just mkdir there. If you‚Äôre new to the console and aren‚Äôt sure how to navigate, here‚Äôs a decent resource to get you started.\nKeep in mind that when you create your site, it will create it within a folder with the name of‚Ä¶ well, whatever you name your site. So, if you‚Äôre making a blog site and you want it to be within your Documents/sites folder, just stay in the sites folder. No need to create one called blog.\nOnce you‚Äôre inside the folder you want to store the site in, we‚Äôll use the following command:\nhugo new site blog\rInstead of blog, use whatever name you want to identify your site. This will create a new folder with all of the necessary files. So, if we type ls you should see your new site folder listed.\nThat‚Äôs it.\nPicking \u0026amp; installing a theme #\rFor most themes, to install, you‚Äôre really just going to clone a GitHub repo into your themes folder. So, first things first, cd into your site folder. In my case that would be\ncd blog\rNow, go to the hugo themes site, and pick one. Remember how I made a big deal about how apt-get install hugo didn‚Äôt install the latest version? That‚Äôs because most of these themes will require a much later version of Hugo than what it initially installed.\nAnyways, pick a theme-I really like Kiss for a super simple blog-and click on the Download button.\nYou‚Äôll want to look for the big green ‚ÄúClone or Download‚Äù button on the themes GitHub page. Click that, and then copy the URL.\nNow go back to your console.\nFirst, we need to initialize Git in your site folder. It‚Äôs pretty simple, just git init. If you don‚Äôt have Git installed, go ahead and install it first. Then, we want to tell Git to clone and download the theme files into the appropriate folder. By telling it to put the theme in themes/kiss it will automatically create the folder for me.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/ribice/kiss.git themes/kiss\rLet it do its thing. It should look something like this.\nSetting the theme #\rOnce that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôve pretty much installed a theme. You‚Äôll need to tell your site to use the theme, especially if you have multiple themes installed (which you can totally do). The first thing you‚Äôll want to do is add the theme to your config.toml file. This is where a lot of basic information for your site will go. Being a .toml file, it‚Äôs a sort of database for Hugo to pull information from when it‚Äôs building your site later on. Once you‚Äôve downloaded and decided on a theme, go ahead and add it to your config.toml file: theme = \u0026quot;themeName\u0026quot;.\nIf you‚Äôve installed multiple themes, and you want to try some different ones, you can use -t to tell Hugo which theme to use when building your site. In a bit, we‚Äôll go over how to view your site on Hugo‚Äôs built-in local server, which is a great way to view and try different themes locally.\nAdding some content #\rRight now, you‚Äôve got a site with a theme, but nothing else. Let‚Äôs make a new blog post to test out how the site looks.\nhugo new posts/test.md\rThis tells Hugo to create a new post called test.md. .md files are Markdown files. Markdown is a great way to quickly and easily write content for the web. It has it‚Äôs own, simple, syntax, and then Hugo will spit that out at HTML in your site files. It‚Äôs worth learning a bit of Markdown to make writing your posts easy (and honestly quite fun).\nGo ahead and open your new Markdown file in your favorite text editor. It will be in the posts folder within your site folder. The first thing you‚Äôll see is a bit of metadata that Hugo automatically added to the top of the file. For now, let‚Äôs just leave that as-is.\nGo ahead and add some text underneath that metadata-after the second set of dashes-and then save the file.\nCongrats! You just added some content to your site!\nViewing the site locally using the Hugo server #\rHead back over to your console, and make sure that you‚Äôre in your site folder. If you‚Äôve done everything the way I‚Äôve described, you should already be there, but it never hurts to make sure. Whenever you‚Äôre working on your site, and you want to view it in the broswer locally, you‚Äôll use the Hugo server. This is the built-in local server that comes with Hugo, and it makes it super easy to build and view your site with one simple command.\nhugo server\rThat‚Äôs it.\nNow you can go to http://localhost:1313/ to view your site. However, if you left the metadata on your test.md file alone, you‚Äôre probably not seeing that post. That‚Äôs because Hugo creates a new post as a draft by default, and running the server normally will ignore drafts. To see your drafts as well, all you have to do is add -D after the server command. First, cancel the current instance of the server using ctrl+c. Then:\nhugo server -D\rNow you should be able to refresh the site and see your post! It will likely say ‚Äú:Draft‚Äù after it, letting you know that it‚Äôs a draft.\nTo view your site with different themes, simply do like this:\nhugo server -t themeName\rFun fact: Hugo server has an auto-refresh feature, so if you make a change to your posts while it‚Äôs running, your changes will appear as soon as you save the file. No need to refresh! It‚Äôs pretty great, but I have had instances when I needed to refresh the page a few times to see a bigger styling change or the like.\nGo Have Fun! #\rFrom here, go ahead and play around! If you want to do something specific with the site, Hugo‚Äôs own docs are a great resource, but there are plenty of people out there who know what they‚Äôre doing, and more than willing to help.\nHosting Your Hugo Site Online #\rSimply run the hugo command within in your site folder to build the site. This will create a folder called public, which contains all the normal site files in .html, .css, etc.\nThere are various ways to host a Hugo site. I personally host mine on GitHub Pages. I found this guide to be extremely helpful for getting that working (along with a lot of trial and error). You could upload files via ftp. Whatever you feel comfortable with.\nI hope that you‚Äôre finding as much joy in building with Hugo as I have. It‚Äôs allowed me to quickly, easily, and enjoyably build static websites, even on a busy schedule. I can‚Äôt wait to build something else!\n","date":"May 9 2018","permalink":"/posts/hugo-blog-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"Part 2: Installing Hugo #\rIntro #\rAlright, so you‚Äôre excited about creating your new website and you‚Äôre excited to give Hugo a try.","title":"Spinning Up a Hugo Blog - Part 2"},{"content":"Or, How I Made This Blog #\rI‚Äôve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant. For one reason or another, I just didn‚Äôt feel like I should. This was of course silly, especially given the number of articles out there that make it clear, the best way to start a blog is to start one.\nChoosing a tech stack #\rOne of the main reasons I never started one was because I wanted to make a blog site that was custom, easy to use, and fast. In the past, any sites I‚Äôve made have been made completely static using good ‚Äòol HTML \u0026amp; CSS. Somewhat recently, however, I had to get used to the idea of using WordPress for my new job. Not only did I discover that WordPress isn‚Äôt as terrible as I always imagined, it can be kind of fun! But that didn‚Äôt change my mind about using it for a blog-it‚Äôs just too heavy for something so simple.\nFor a while I thought my only options were to manually create, organize, and style my pages, or to use some sort of templating tool. A blog didn‚Äôt seem like it was worth the work of doing everything manually, and I was too lacking in web dev finesse to want to mess with template systems or the like.\nLearning about static site generators #\rI‚Äôve been listening to The Shop Talk Show for a while now, and there was one episode where Dave Rupert was talking about this thing that could make static websites by just running a few commands in a console. This was well before I had spent much time in a console, but that sounded cool! It also sounded like exactly what I‚Äôd want to use for a simple blog. (Only) a couple of years later, and I decided to give it a try.\nIf you are a listener of that wonderful podcast, or you‚Äôve spent more than a few months in the web dev community, you can probably guess what I‚Äôm talking about. It is, of course, Jekyll. If you didn‚Äôt know that, or don‚Äôt know much about it, Jekyll is what is called a static site generator. Basically, a static site generator is a program that uses a database to take a bunch of random (well, not really) files and smash them together into a fully functional website. Jekyll is likely the most well known and loved static site generator out there today.\nHowever, even Jekyll turned out to be more complicated than what I wanted. Jekyll is very, very cool, and is surprisingly good at scaling to different needs. And while there are certainly easier ways of getting a site up and running with Jekyll, I‚Äôve found myself more and more enjoying my time in the console, and wanted to be able to do things quickly and easily there, without having to spend hours learning, installing dependencies, troubleshooting, etc.\nFinding Hugo #\rAfter a bit of searching around, I came across Hugo. Hugo is also a static site generator, but it‚Äôs a bit‚Ä¶ lighter. After a bit of research this seemed like the perfect option for me and my new blog. It‚Äôs extremely easy to install, run, and works quite well with Github Pages, which is what I wanted to use to host my blog. Getting the blog live on Pages was far and away more difficult than building a site with Hugo, and you really only to set it up once to get things working. Now, all I really need to do is write a post using beautiful Markdown, and push to Github. That‚Äôs. It.\nSo, here we are, Hugo + Github Pages (and a custom domain) and I‚Äôve got my ideal blogging solution that will allow me to expand a bit here and there as I go, without having to really worry about much else.\nPart 2 #\rJoin me in Part 2 to see how to install and get started with Hugo.\n","date":"April 17 2018","permalink":"/posts/hugo-blog/","section":"Posts","summary":"Or, How I Made This Blog #\rI‚Äôve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant.","title":"Spinning Up a Hugo Blog - Part 1"},{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s going on here? #\rI write about my interests. #\rAs of right now, that is really about the gist of it! I‚Äôve wanted to start a blog for a long time. However, I never really thought I had anything worth sharing. And, honestly, not much has changed. One thing that has changed, though, is my perspective on whether or not that matters. Turns out, it doesn‚Äôt. But something does‚Ä¶\nA confession #\rI have a confession: I hated writing papers in high-school. When I had to, I gave minimal effort, minimal interest, and didn‚Äôt think twice about the fact that I believed these papers were meaningless. This was largely my own fault. I‚Äôve never been a terribly motivated person, and homework brought out this trait of mine doubly so.\nMy environment didn‚Äôt help all that much, though, either. I was never taught the joy of writing. I never witnessed that conveying something interesting or important to yourself or others through the written word can be enjoyable, satisfying, and rewarding.\nSo how and when did that part of me change? Probably in my sophomore year in college. I went to a general education college with a focus in graphic design. One of the required courses for all students was an English class. It turned out that the class largely focused on writing papers. I was not excited.\nBut what was different about that class from what I received in high-school? I‚Äôm quite positive I‚Äôve figured out how to answer that question, and I‚Äôll admit that it took me a while. I‚Äôm quite sure it all comes down to interest. Nothing in this world can quite feel meaningful or worthwhile without some amount of interest, whether that is in regards to something you are doing, making, reading, consuming, or writing.\nNow, when I started that class, I didn‚Äôt go into it with interest. No, I was going to treat this class like all of my other English courses. I was going to cruise through this class with minimal effort and a satisfactory grade. No, this time it all came down to my professor. Sure, he was passionate about writing, but I sure wasn‚Äôt, and no amount of kind words towards the activity were going to change my mind. However, what he did do differently than my past teachers, even if the topic I was writing about was absolutely ridiculous (\u0026quot;Is McDonald‚Äôs Really That Bad?\u0026quot;), was that he showed interest in my topics and my writing, despite my lack of it. He asked questions about how writing was going. He gave suggestions on where and how to research beyond the usual ‚Äúgo to the library‚Äù. He not only let me know what I was doing wrong when proofing my papers, but also remarked on things he found interesting about how I phrased something or a bit of research I found. He read into things that I didn‚Äôt even mean to be there, which made me interested in my own writing! Essentially, he made writing those papers feel worthwhile, because I found that someone, even myself sometimes, was actually getting something out of reading them.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve been craving that feeling ever since\u0026hellip; I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know it yet.\nMaking it happen #\rSo here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing with this blog. I‚Äôm writing for the fun of it. I‚Äôm writing about my interests because that makes writing interesting. And rather than relying on a professor‚Äôs feedback to keep me motivated to keep writing, I think that my own interest will be enough to keep writing. And if you find any interest while reading what I write, well then that‚Äôs just icing on the cake, isn‚Äôt it?\n","date":"March 22 2018","permalink":"/posts/blog-intro/","section":"Posts","summary":"What\u0026rsquo;s going on here?","title":"Baby's First Blog Post"},{"content":"","date":"January 1 0001","permalink":"/work/","section":"","summary":"","title":"My Work History"}]
