[{"content":"\rWhen I first started in web development, if someone told me that making my code readable was important, I would have thought two things: 1. duh, and 2. that only applies in team settings, which didn\u0026rsquo;t apply to me at the time. But, after working in front-end development environments for nearly a decade now, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that writing readable code is no simple thing. I\u0026rsquo;ve also learned how frustrating it can be when you or a co-worker fail to do it correctly, if at all.\nSo what is readable code, how do we write it, and is it necessary all the time?\nDisclaimer #\rFirst things first: these are my own opinions and you and/or your team should discuss what works best for you. These are by no means hard-and-fast rules that you yourself should follow, but rather my own observations from my years working in the field. Feel free to tell me all the ways I\u0026rsquo;m wrong in an email.\nWhat is Readable Code? #\rSimply put, readable code is code that anyone can jump into and navigate, edit, and maintain without having to decipher the developer\u0026rsquo;s original intent.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example: Your team has hired a new developer with great JS chops, but they\u0026rsquo;ve never used the framework your team is using for a particular project. They\u0026rsquo;ve glanced over the docs for the framework and have a basic understanding of it. How quickly will they be able to get into that project and make changes that A. work well within the system you\u0026rsquo;ve already built, and B. don\u0026rsquo;t break stuff? If the code was written to be readable, they should have no problem figuring out what each bit of code is doing, make their changes where necessary, and ensure that everything works as expected afterwards.\nHopefully, they know how to make their code readable, too, which will make sure the next developer isn\u0026rsquo;t caught off-guard with new code to decipher. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at some basics on how to do it.\nHow To Make Code Readable #\rComments #\rComments are the quickest and possibly the most effective way to make your code more readable. And yet, they\u0026rsquo;re one of the most frequently neglected methods.\nI think as developers we have a tendency to try to solve problems as quickly as possible, which often means jumping into the code before anything else. We just want to get a few lines down to get the idea started! Often, this leads to writing dozens of lines before adding a single comment, leading to us wanting to finish what we\u0026rsquo;ve started before considering whether it is the best solution or how it fits into the bigger picture. And, of course we always intend to go back to add those comments, right?\nNot always. Here\u0026rsquo;s something to try: Comment out your core functionality before you even write any code. Think of it as an index and outline for the code you\u0026rsquo;re about to write. Not only will this make adding clear, concise comments throughout the code easier, but it will help you think through the problem before starting on a solution, which can help you come to better solutions. Win win!\nExamples #\rLet\u0026rsquo;s look at a couple of examples.\nCSS\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you need to write some CSS for a little \u0026lsquo;About Me\u0026rsquo; style card. You\u0026rsquo;ll have an image at the top, a title of the person\u0026rsquo;s name, and a short blurb about them. Throw some comments in\u0026hellip; Something like this.\n/* Start About Me Card */ /* Container Styles */ /* Image Styles */ /* Title Styles */ /* Bio Styles */ /* End About Me Card */ Now, we have already added some comments telling other developers what each section of the stylesheet will address, and we also have an outline for each part that we need to write styles for.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s put some styles in there.\n/* Start About Me Card */ /* Container Styles */ .card { background-color: #f8f8f8; border-radius: .5em; padding: 12px; } /* Image Styles */ .card img { border-radius: .25em; width: 80%; height: auto; } /* Title Styles */ .card h2 { color: #121212; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 2rem; } /* Bio Styles */ .card p { color: #121212; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; } /* End About Me Card */ But, let\u0026rsquo;s say there was something more specific the design team wanted to add after you got started, and you want to make sure other developers were aware of where that\u0026rsquo;s added. Let\u0026rsquo;s say there was one card that needed a special animation on it. It can be helpful to add a comment saying what the animation does and where the keyframes can be found, should they need updated.\n/* Start About Me Card */ /* Container Styles */ .card { background-color: #f8f8f8; border-radius: .5em; padding: 12px; /* Featured cards get \u0026#39;fade-in\u0026#39; animation */ \u0026amp;.featured { animation: fade-in 1s forwards; } } /* Image Styles */ .card img { border-radius: .25em; width: 80%; height: auto; } /* Title Styles */ .card h2 { color: #121212; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 2rem; } /* Bio Styles */ .card p { color: #121212; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; } /* End About Me Card */ Now, we have context on what\u0026rsquo;s being done to cards with the class featured and what animation keyframes to look for if we want to change it.\nCertainly, with most teams, CSS won\u0026rsquo;t need to be commented out in quite that level of detail, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s good to default to at least one comment per section or module of whatever you\u0026rsquo;re working on, along with an index at the top of the stylesheet, so team members can at least orient themselves within the stylesheet at a glance.\nJS\nJavaScript, or any scripting language, requires more detail to ensure that developers not only know what a function is for at a glance, but also what each part is doing.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick example of how I might comment out a function that applies an active class when an element is clicked.\n// Add \u0026#39;active\u0026#39; class to element when clicked // CC - 2.6.25 function addActive() { const element = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;.element\u0026#39;); // If the element exists... if(element) { // When the element is clicked element.addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { // Add the \u0026#39;active\u0026#39; class element.classList.add(\u0026#39;active\u0026#39;); }) } } The purpose of each part of the function is now clearly described. Easy! Notice how I also included my initials and the date. This can be helpful for other developers to know who added something and when, which can add helpful context should something stop working later on.\nBut, comments aren\u0026rsquo;t the only way to make your code more readable.\nNaming Conventions #\rA lot of people have a lot of strong feelings about how to name CSS classes, IDs, function names, etc. But, at the end of the day, what matters is that you and your team are on the same page about how and what to name these things.\nThat said, it\u0026rsquo;s my opinion that names should:\nBe Descriptive - whether a function name, variable name, or a CSS class name, the name should describe the contents. For example, if the class is for a heading, consider adding \u0026lsquo;heading\u0026rsquo; in the name. Follow a System - talk with your team about establishing a system for naming things. For example, you could say that all CSS classes should start with your company abbreviation followed by an underscore, the module name, then something more specific. .cc_bio-card_image { width: 100%; height: auto; } Follow Known Conventions - for example, it\u0026rsquo;s common practice for PHP variables to be in camel case, or for CSS class names to use dashes and underscores. Knowing and following these conventions can help keep code readable by not subverting expectations. Use Simple Code #\rAs developers, we love a shorthand. It keeps code clean, reduces overall file size, and it just feels cool to write. But, it can often come at a cost in terms of readability.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at a pretty common, super simple JS example. Look at the two following scripts and think about which is easier to read at a glance.\nExample one:\nlet fontColor = isBlue ? \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39; : \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;; Example two:\nlet fontColor = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; if (isBlue) { fontColor = \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;; } else { fontColor = \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;; } Quite a bit easier to understand the second one at a glance, right? Now think about how this effect would multiply across a whole project! Personally, I\u0026rsquo;d rather write the second and use tools to minify my code for production, but your team needs to consider and agree on the pluses and minuses of these types of trade offs.\nNow, obviously good comments will help make the first example easier to understand, but having both is great, too.\nIndentation \u0026amp; Formatting #\rSimilar to naming conventions, how your code is formatted can impact how readable your code is. While there are various methodologies for pretty much any language in terms of where to put indents, spaces, etc. the important thing here is to be consistent, as not doing so makes your code less predictable.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at a couple of CSS declarations:\n.class-one { color: #fff;text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;} .class-two, .class-three {margin-right: 1em; padding: 5% } Technically, this is valid CSS, but I think we can all agree that this is A. quite ugly, and B. not quick to read. That is, in part, because it\u0026rsquo;s inconsistent.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s clean it up.\n.class-one { color: #fff; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline; } .class-two, .class-three { margin-right: 1em; padding: 5%; } Looks much better! And, it has the bonus of being much more predictable, and therefore readable.\nNow that we\u0026rsquo;ve covered why writing readable code matters and a bit about how to write it, let\u0026rsquo;s answer the question: is it always necessary?\nWhen Is It Necessary? #\rOn a Team #\rHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing\u0026hellip; As I stated from the beginning, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to discuss with your team how you want to format your code and when it\u0026rsquo;s necessary. If you decide you want to write your code one way, but your team another, that\u0026rsquo;s just asking for trouble. It\u0026rsquo;s worth setting up a meeting for this kind of stuff and all getting on the same page, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already.\nI know that I don\u0026rsquo;t always follow through with writing the best code possible, but I do try to at least meet the standards that my team has set, and will do more to improve on top of that if time allows.\nBut, what if you\u0026rsquo;re working on a personal project or just writing something you know only you will be working on?\nWithout a Team #\rAt that point, it\u0026rsquo;s really your choice, but I\u0026rsquo;d ask you to consider a few things:\nWould it be good practice to ensure your code is readable, even if you\u0026rsquo;re the only one reading it? Will you benefit in the future by making sure your code is readable? How can you be so sure that no one else will use or edit this code in the future? Will this code ever be seen by a potential employer or colleague? For me, I find that striking a good balance on personal projects is a good approach. I don\u0026rsquo;t need things to be perfect, but I\u0026rsquo;d like my code to be pretty clean and readable, even if just for myself.\nClosing #\rI hope you\u0026rsquo;ve learned a bit reading this article, and that it\u0026rsquo;s either kindled a newfound appreciation for writing readable code, or provided new ideas on how you can improve your code moving forward. If you have any feedback or suggestions for me, feel free to let me know\u0026hellip; And then go build something!\n","date":"February 9 2025","permalink":"/posts/readable-code/","section":"Posts","summary":"When I first started in web development, if someone told me that making my code readable was important, I would have thought two things: 1.","title":"Let's Talk About Readable Code"},{"content":"\r","date":"February 1 2025","permalink":"/posts/photos-2-1-25/","section":"Posts","summary":"\r","title":"A Walk Around Pickerel Lake"},{"content":"\r","date":"February 1 2025","permalink":"/photoroll/","section":"","summary":"\r","title":"Photoroll"},{"content":"\rTaken 12.29.24 at The Highlands in Grand Rapids, MI\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the end of 2024, and while a lot of things have changed, one thing has not: I still like tinkering with technology! With that said, my budget is a bit different than it used to be (and by that I mean I\u0026rsquo;m actually trying to stick to a budget). Part of trying to wrangle my money has been cutting monthly or even yearly subscriptions. That actually hasn\u0026rsquo;t been too difficult save for one\u0026hellip;\nAdobe #\rAnyone who does photography, graphic design, or video editing will know how much of a strangle-hold Adobe has on the creative fields. We\u0026rsquo;re taught to use Adobe\u0026rsquo;s software from day one in school, and so of course we continue to reach for their software in our professional lives, as well. The new subscription models are cheap, too, for what you get, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s also the best option for a hobbyist looking to get the most out of the expensive gear they\u0026rsquo;ve purchased.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not just marketing. Want to learn something new? That tutorial you found on YouTube will probably be for Adobe software. Want to download a plugin that\u0026rsquo;s purpose built for something you do? It\u0026rsquo;s probably available for Adobe first. Want to use a file your friend sent you? Adobe. It\u0026rsquo;s the creative ecosystem we\u0026rsquo;ve all come to know and love, whether we wanted to or not.\nBut, there are alternatives, and they\u0026rsquo;re pretty great! Here I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about a few I\u0026rsquo;ve been using for Lightroom, Photoshop, and Premiere, and how the switch has been going.\nLightroom #\rThis is one of the more difficult ones for me. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Lightroom since about 2015 and I\u0026rsquo;ve used it often. It\u0026rsquo;s been my go-to and only RAW post-processor since graduating from college, and I know it quite well at this point. It\u0026rsquo;s intuitive, performs well, and gets regular, welcome updates. Overall I\u0026rsquo;d put this at the top of Adobe\u0026rsquo;s software. It does what it needs to do and it does it well. But, the cheapest plan for both Lightroom and Photoshop in 2025 will soon be $15/mo. Really not bad for what you\u0026rsquo;re getting, but also not in the cards for me right now. So what will I be using instead?\nDarkTable #\rThis one was a tough to start to get the hang of, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, I\u0026rsquo;ve never really \u0026ldquo;gotten\u0026rdquo; it. I\u0026rsquo;ve just sorta figured out the basics to make passable edits to my photos and need to look up tutorials for just about every module I use regularly. But it\u0026rsquo;s really cool, and there are a plethora of good tutorials on YouTube or in blogs to help you along. I only wish there were more high-profile photographers using the software, which would bring more attention to usability and some of the rough edges might be softened out.\nThere is one thing, however, that Lightroom can do that DarkTable can\u0026rsquo;t, and it\u0026rsquo;s is proving to be a tough one for me: Panorama stitching. More on that below.\nMy rating as a Lightroom replacement: 8/10. If some kind and knowledgeable soul out there could add a viable panorama stitching feature I\u0026rsquo;d bump this up to a 10.\nHugin #\rHugin is probably the best free panorama stiching software out there, but it\u0026rsquo;s far from intuitive, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t quite figured it out yet. Look closely at the image below. Can you spot the issue?\nClick the image for a larger view.\nQuite possibly not, it\u0026rsquo;s not bad from a distance. How about now?\nWell, of course you see it now, I made it obvious! Seems pretty nitpicky, I know, but that\u0026rsquo;s going to stand out like a sore thumb if this image is printed larger than postcard size, and it would bother me every time I looked at it!\nI know Hugin can do better, and I just need to learn the software, but for now, it\u0026rsquo;s a: 5/10.\nPhotoshop #\rAdmittedly, I don\u0026rsquo;t use Photoshop much these days outside of work, and even then I only do because it\u0026rsquo;s what the team uses. At home, though, the only thing I was using it for was the odd request from a family member, editing my resume, or batch processing.\nGIMP #\rGIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) can do most of that with relative ease (though the learning curve is not fun). But, what it can\u0026rsquo;t do as well as Photoshop is object removal and batch processing. Luckily, as a protest to the advent of large language image generation models, I\u0026rsquo;ve vowed (to myself, mostly) not to remove objects from my images anymore. However, batch processing was trickier.\nImageMagick #\rI\u0026rsquo;ve already shared some of the cool stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve done with ImageMagick here, but I\u0026rsquo;ve since written a new script to make a new folder in the working folder, copy all JPEGs to that folder, change to that folder, and then resize each image to the appropriate size for sharing on Instagram while adding a small white border around the image. All I need is a terminal window and it does the rest for me. Pretty cool!\nI\u0026rsquo;ll leave the bash script here, in case you\u0026rsquo;re interested. If you make any improvements to it, I\u0026rsquo;d love to see what you came up with!\n#! /usr/bin/bash mkdir border; cp *.jpg border; cd border; mogrify -resize 1020 -bordercolor \u0026#34;#ffffff\u0026#34; -border 30x30 *.jpg Of course, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a shell with ImageMagick installed for the script to run properly.\nI recognize that ImageMagick isn\u0026rsquo;t much of a Photoshop replacement, but it\u0026rsquo;s faster and lighter (and free), so for what I use it for? 10/10.\nTaken 12.29.24 at The Highlands in Grand Rapids, MI\nPremiere #\rTo be honest, I never used Premiere much, either, as I gave up on making videos for a long time. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve recently become more interested in it after working at my current job for a while and getting to see some of the inner-workings of our video team. So, I\u0026rsquo;ve started taking short clips here and there with my Sony A7 II, just to experiment. Now, I could just shoot in the default settings and get perfectly usable footage straight out of the camera, but I wanted to experiment with shooting LOG and color grading in post. The cheapest subscription from Adobe that includes Premiere is $23/mo and that includes just Premiere Pro. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t even include After Effects, which I\u0026rsquo;m guessing most videographers would argue goes hand-in-hand with Premiere. So where does that leave me?\nDavinci Resolve #\rThis is a free non-linear video editor that offers a bunch of great features for no money at all. It\u0026rsquo;s editing time line is super easy to get used to, and the color grading features are top-notch, even on the free version. For a hobbyist or new studio doing basic edits, it\u0026rsquo;s more than enough. Plus, if I did ever want to get the full set of tools, you can purchase a studio license for $300, which is pretty good for top-of-the-line software.\nMy rating of Resolve as a Premier Pro replacement? 10/10\nSome quick clips from a recent hike in the rain.\nClose #\rIf I wanted to get all three of the aforementioned programs from Adobe\u0026ndash;Lightroom, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro\u0026ndash;it would cost me a whopping $60/mo, or $720/yr! Let me be clear: For pros, that\u0026rsquo;s a steal, but for a hobbyist, that\u0026rsquo;s just too much. However, thanks to the skill and kindness of FOSS (free and open source software) developers, Davinci\u0026rsquo;s free video editor, and some tinkering, I can tackle all of my creative projects without spending a dime. Pretty amazing, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see what I can create in 2025!\n","date":"December 30 2024","permalink":"/posts/switching-up-my-tools/","section":"Posts","summary":"Taken 12.","title":"Switching Up My Tools"},{"content":"We went downtown for the first time in\u0026hellip; Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t even know how long on Monday night.

I got into photography, in part, because of my brother. I think he\u0026rsquo;s cool, so I wanted to do the things he did. But it was also watching him use his DSLR, and my parents their point-and-shoot cameras, that made me want to try out those tools. It was, in part, the gear.

This wasn\u0026rsquo;t the camera that made me fall in love with photography, but it did solidify that love.\nPreviously I had only had and shot with point-and-shoot cameras. I actually still have my Canon PowerShot SD780 IS. It\u0026rsquo;s not that they were bad\u0026hellip; In fact they all did a wonderful job of capturing memories, but it was clear that there were better options for the budding hobbyist. So, I gave up my savings and purchased my first DSLR. This opened up a side of photography to me that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t experienced with my other cameras. First, this was my first camera with full manual controls. Secondly, I could now shoot in RAW.\nThese two aspects of the DSLR shooting experience, manual controls and RAW format, really helped me pursue photography as a pastime and creative outlet. The medium became not just about capturing a moment, but about the process and the joy of using a camera. This joy culminated when, years later, I inherited a Canon AE-1 from my grandfather.\nIntro to Film 🎞️ #\rYou can read more about why I love film photography so much in one of my previous posts, but to me it is the epitome of photography as a tactile and physical process. And, for a while, most of my photography was made on film. However, time moved on and the costs associated with film added up. It started to become more and more difficult to justify. So, I began seeking something that would give me that joy without having to pay $1+ per shot.\nEnter, Fuji 🗻 #\rIn 2018 I purchased my first Fujifilm camera, the Fujifilm X-T20. I fell in love with the tactile manual controls, the vintage looks, and the beautiful image files. I learned so much with that camera, and it went with me through camping trips, late night walks downtown, Scotland, and Portugal.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the camera with which I learned that aperture priority mode is (usually) better than manual or shutter priority. It\u0026rsquo;s the camera with which I learned how to take proper long exposures (without just turning my shutter to thirty seconds and hoping for the best). And it\u0026rsquo;s the camera that kept reminding me of why I got into photography in the first place\u0026hellip; The joy of making photographs with a beautiful piece of kit.\nInclement Weather 🌩️ #\rIt was after our trip to Scotland and Portugal, in 2019, that I started worrying about weather sealing. This was due to the number of times I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable bringing my X-T20 out of its bag during the unpredictable weather of the Scottish highlands. None of the lenses I had at the time were WR lenses, and to upgrade to a weather sealed Fuji body would have cost $1,200 at a minimum (probably more with today\u0026rsquo;s prices), maybe $600-700 if I bought something used. I let that experience get the better of me and began looking for the cheapest way to get a fully weather sealed kit.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I found out and learned about the Micro Four Thirds system. Arguably the best system for hobbyists, Micro Four Thirds offers hugely in terms of features at very reasonable prices. And I loved the look (and size) of the Olympus E-M5 II. This camera, paired with the Lumix 12-60mm f3.5-5.6, offered an extremely affordable, very small and lightweight kit.\nI used this setup quite happily for a long time, but then I let something else get the better of me.\nThe Pursuit of IQ 🔍 #\rIt seems silly, now, to think that I wanted better image quality. I rarely print a photo, and even my old T1i offered dynamic range and ISO performance that I could get away with. But, between pixel peeping and often shooting at shallow depth-of-fields, I wanted to try full-frame, and the cheapest way to get a \u0026ldquo;weather sealed\u0026rdquo; full-frame kit was the Sony A7II. So, I gave it a try, and I really liked it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise, this is a great camera. And the 28-70mm kit lens is no slouch. The A7II is plenty fast enough for casual photography and its 24mp sensor (with IBIS) is very capable, even today. And the 28-70mm offers a fairly versatile zoom range at normal speeds in a very small (for full frame) package. I’d much rather have it than the new trend of super small but short and slow kit lenses.\nSo, why didn’t it last? It sounds like it had everything going for it! There are a few reasons.\nOne, the image quality was better than the Olympus, but not so much better than the Fujifilm that it mattered day-to-day (for me). In fact, in some scenarios the Fujifilm\u0026rsquo;s X-Trans sensor does look better than the Sony full-frame. Second, the lenses… I don’t need a lot when it comes to lenses, but the lenses I would want on a full-frame Sony are relatively large and expensive compared the Fuji equivalents. Third is the carryability of the thing, or rather lack there of. It’s not that the Sony was so big that it was unwieldily, but it wasn’t what I would call discreet. Fourth, I kept seeing those darned beautiful Instagram posts of Fujifilm gear! So, Now What? 🤷 #\rBack to Fuji, and now I\u0026rsquo;m here to stay. At least\u0026hellip; For now. As of the time of writing this, the Fuji X-T20, the camera that started my journey with Fujifilm, is one of the cheapest ways to get into the system. So, I picked one up, along with the super cheap but fun TTArtisans 27mm f2.8.\nYou see, the Olympus offered portability and affordability, and the Sony offered quality. But Fujifilm offers something neither can really give me: making taking a photograph a beautiful experience.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s enough for me.\n","date":"May 30 2023","permalink":"/posts/fuji-x/","section":"Posts","summary":"If I said that gear didn\u0026rsquo;t make up a large percentage of why I love photography, I\u0026rsquo;d be lying.","title":"There And Back Again, a Fuji X Tale"},{"content":"I love a rainy day.

The colors pop against the dark bark, and the sounds and smells are calming. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful time to be in the woods.\nIt also happens to offer great opportunities for moody photographs, something I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying more and more.

At first, I thought it was just fun, but that doing things with a UI was still more intuitive and efficient. But over time, my mind has changed on that. Recently, I was performing a task that I do frequently and that can get very repetitive, and I thought that there just had to be a better way.\nThe Problem #\rAs a web developer and photographer, I am gathering, resizing, and optimizing images for the web on a daily basis. Typically this involves putting the images I need together in the appropriate folder, running them all through something like ImageOptim, and then using export for web in Photoshop to achieve a manageable file size.\nThis workflow works well, but has a few downsides:\nOne, it’s time consuming. Sure, I can use Adobe Bridge and batch process files, but I find the UI a bit clunky and confusing, it then requires multiple apps open at once, and it’s generally inefficient Two, Adobe recently began charging more per month to get both Lightroom and Photoshop, and I simply don’t want to spend money every month to do such a simple task And three, the above tools are not available for Linux, pushing me to look at alternatives. Enter the Terminal #\rThe terminal allows the user to tell the computer to do something simply by typing. And there are apps that use this interface to complete tasks. For example, ImageMagick provides a bunch of useful image processing options via the command line. Two that are important to me are resizing and optimization. Another great app is jpegoptim, which has similar features to ImageOptim, but without the UI.\nUsing these is great, but they present a couple of additional issues: typing can be cumbersome, and you have to remember the commands.\nThe Solution #\rBash allows any user to create and run scripts within the terminal. These can be as simple as echoing out “Hello World” or as complicated as entire games (yes, you play them within the terminal). For my purposes, what I liked most about the idea of writing a script, is that it would allow me to string together a series of tasks, taking into account my input for certain things, by just running a single command.\nTo test the idea, I started relatively simple. You see, on GNU/Linux systems you can update all of your apps using the terminal. Keeping track of what you can update with which command, though can be tricky, because while my Debian-based system uses the APT package manager for apps and packages, I also use apps that use Snap and Flatpak. But, what if I could update all three with just one command? A script lets me do that.\nIt Starts With A Bang #\rShebang, to be precise. This basically tells the system that what it\u0026rsquo;s about to read is meant to be executed by a specified interpreter. In my instance, that is Bash.\n#!/bin/bash From there a bash script can contain a meriad of things including echoing out text, creating and accepting variables, conditionals, etc. It can also contain commands. For my purposes, I start by running the standard command to update apt package repositories.\nsudo apt update Followed by the command to upgrade any apps with available updates.\nsudo apt upgrade I also include the \u0026lsquo;-y\u0026rsquo; flag, telling the program to automatically select Yes when prompted to upgrade something. Altogether, the first line looks like this: sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade -y. Pretty simple, right? That takes care of our core apps and packages through apt.\nWhat about Snaps? That is also pretty simple: sudo snap refresh.\nAnd lastly, Flatpaks: flatpak update.\nI also threw in some text to break up the updates and let myself know where things are at in the process. The whole script looks like this:\n#! /usr/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;First, let\u0026#39;s update your packages and .deb apps.\u0026#34; sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade -y echo \u0026#34;Nice, now let\u0026#39;s update your snaps.\u0026#34; sudo snap refresh echo \u0026#34;Now that\u0026#39;s done, how about flatpaks?\u0026#34; flatpak update echo \u0026#34;Done! Now check for errors and fix accordingly.\u0026#34; Seems pretty simple, right? It is! But that\u0026rsquo;s sort of the beauty of it. This one simple block of code allows me to run all of those updates, complete with a bit of flavor text, by typing one word (followed by .sh) into my terminal! Doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a whole lot, I know, so let\u0026rsquo;s look at another script I wrote.\nImage Optimization #\rThis one is a bit more involved, and utilizes the programs I mentioned earlier. What\u0026rsquo;s the goal? To be able to pop into any folder of images (assuming they\u0026rsquo;re jpegs) and run one command to resize, optimize, and strip the EXIF data off all of them in one go. We start with\u0026hellip;\n#! /usr/bin/bash But you already knew that.\nNext, we\u0026rsquo;ll use imagemagick to resize the images. But to what size? Well, I\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to tell it what size I want when I run the script, that way I can potentially use it for multiple purposes. The simplest command to resize (that I\u0026rsquo;ve found) is mogrify -resize (your width in pixels) *.jpg. This will resize all .jpg files in the directory to the width you choose. It will automatically skip folders and files that it can\u0026rsquo;t modify. But, we want to be able to tell the program what width to use in the script, and to do this we\u0026rsquo;ll need two things: user prompts and variables. We need a prompt for the user to enter a number, and a variable to put that number into the mogrify command.\nLearning to Read #\rThe read command essentially lets us prompt the user to type something in and, assuming the user does, stores that value. We\u0026rsquo;ll be asking the user to input their desired image width and then storing that input into a variable called \u0026lsquo;width.\u0026rsquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty simple, but powerful, combination that looks like this read width. This variable can be used later with $width. But, what do we do with that value once we have it?\nIf This Then That #\rNow, we\u0026rsquo;ll plug that number into the -resize command I mentioned earlier. But it\u0026rsquo;s important to consider what happens if the user doesn\u0026rsquo;t do what\u0026rsquo;s expected. I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that I could have accounted for more scenarios, but I did at least want to have a fallback, or default, for how wide to make images if the user leaves their response blank. To do this, we\u0026rsquo;ll use a conditional that says, \u0026ldquo;If the user inputs a number, use that as the image width. But, if the user didn\u0026rsquo;t answer, make the images 2400px wide.\u0026rdquo; Why 2400px? Idk.\nif [ $width ]; then echo \u0026#34;Running...\u0026#34; mogrify -resize $width *.jpg else echo \u0026#34;No input, defaulting to 2400w.\u0026#34; width=2400 mogrify -resize $width *.jpg fi Of course, imagemagick has some conditionals of its own, and while you\u0026rsquo;re running my script, if it runs into any errors, it\u0026rsquo;ll let you know.\nQuality Over Quality #\rNext, we\u0026rsquo;ll set the quality we want. We prompt the user for their desired quality (in this case a percentage)\u0026hellip;\necho \u0026#34;What quality level do you want your images to be?\u0026#34; read quality And then plug that into the next command, with 80 percent being the default\u0026hellip;\nif [ $quality ]; then echo \u0026#34;Running...\u0026#34; mogrify -quality $quality *.jpg else echo \u0026#34;No input, defaulting to 80 quality.\u0026#34; quality=80 mogrify -quality $quality *.jpg fi Make sense? I\u0026rsquo;m sure it does. You\u0026rsquo;re very smart after all. Which is why you\u0026rsquo;re asking, we\u0026rsquo;re going to strip the EXIF data now, right? But what if we don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that this time?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Strip #\rI\u0026rsquo;m going to be honest, I haven\u0026rsquo;t completely wrapped my head around this one yet. But I do know that it works. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use a while loop with a case statement to ask the user if they want to strip the EXIF data and, if they do, do it.\nwhile true; do read -p \u0026#34;Would you like to strip EXIF data? \u0026#34; yn case $yn in [Yy]* ) mogrify -strip *.jpg; break;; [Nn]* ) exit;; * ) echo \u0026#34;Please answer yes or no.\u0026#34;;; esac done And that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much it! Altogether it looks like this:\n#! /usr/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;How wide do you want your images to be?\u0026#34; read width if [ $width ]; then echo \u0026#34;Running...\u0026#34; mogrify -resize $width *.jpg else echo \u0026#34;No input, defaulting to 2400w.\u0026#34; width=2400 mogrify -resize $width *.jpg fi echo \u0026#34;What quality level do you want your images to be?\u0026#34; read quality if [ $quality ]; then echo \u0026#34;Running...\u0026#34; mogrify -quality $quality *.jpg else echo \u0026#34;No input, defaulting to 80 quality.\u0026#34; quality=80 mogrify -quality $quality *.jpg fi while true; do read -p \u0026#34;Would you like to strip EXIF data? \u0026#34; yn case $yn in [Yy]* ) mogrify -strip *.jpg; break;; [Nn]* ) exit;; * ) echo \u0026#34;Please answer yes or no.\u0026#34;;; esac done echo \u0026#34;Done.\u0026#34; And here it is in action:\nuser@linux:~/test$ img.sh How wide do you want your images to be? 1280 Running... What quality level do you want your images to be? 75 Running... Would you like to strip EXIF data? y Done. With that, I\u0026rsquo;ve resized all .jpg files in the current directory to 1280px wide at a quality of 75 and with EXIF data stripped. Pretty cool!\nA Whole New World! #\rTo anyone who has had to batch resize, strip, and optimize large numbers of images using the likes of Adobe Bridge and Photoshop the benefits of this CLI approach are obvious. What a time saver! Not to mention it\u0026rsquo;s significantly lighter on resources than Adobe\u0026rsquo;s offerings. And it\u0026rsquo;s gotten me excited about the possibilities of other experiments I can play with and problems I can solve with Bash scripts.\nThe benefits of scripting aren\u0026rsquo;t just for Linux users, too. I’ve actually moved that script over to both macOS (at work) and WSL2 on my Windows partition. Thanks to Windows Subsystem for Linux, Windows users can enjoy Bash scripting in a native environment.\nBy the way, I\u0026rsquo;m quite new to all of this Linux Bash scripty stuff.

If you’ve been hiding under a rock, however, FlexBox is a new(ish) way to create layouts in CSS.\nToday I’m going to share some things I’ve learned about FlexBox since it has become usable in all mainstream and evergreen browsers.\n1. FlexBox isn’t a one stop fix #\rNeed some columns? Use FlexBox. Need to center something? Use FlexBox. Need to make two columns the same height? Use FlexBox. Truly, FlexBox can be used for so many things today that used to require sloppy CSS or even JavaScript.\nBut that doesn’t mean that you can use it for everything, or that it solves every problem. Even with the high level of awesome that FlexBox is, it just won’t always do what you need to do.\nJust be prepared to use other tools if needed. Grid can be very useful and, yes, I even still use floats sometimes!\n2. You can use FlexBox and Grid together #\rFlexBox and Grid are not the same thing. They share a few similarities and can often be used to accomplish the same goals, but there are occasions where you may want to use both. And you should feel just fine doing so!\nThey are both great tools, so use whichever one serves your specific needs best, even if that’s both at the same time.\n3. (Still) use AutoPrefixer #\rFlexBox (and Grid) has great support in evergreen browsers. So great that at this point, there’s really no point in not using it.\nBut that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use prefixes. I’d still recommend them for FlexBox, and running your code through an AutoPrefixer is pretty simple. Chances are you’ll catch some other styles that needed it anyways.\n4. You’ll still need to do some maths #\rWant five columns in that row? Cool! FlexBox can do that! Want each column to be a specific width? Awesome! FlexBox can do that! Want gaps between those columns! Cool… But let’s not get too… Oh, you want to get crazy with the margins and paddings and…\nOkay, so in a perfect project you’ll be able to plan things out in a way where no math is going to be necessary on your end. But let’s be honest, most projects aren’t perfect. Or, if you’re like me, you’re frequently working on sites you didn’t develop or sites that were built before FlexBox was viable.\nIn these cases, you may still have to pull out the old calculator.\n5. You don’t have to use it! #\rMost developers today would say that you’re insane not to use FlexBox, and I’ll admit that I’m one of them! But I also don’t really care if you don’t. As a WordPress Developer, I’ve seen a vast array of styling techniques and, despite the popularity of newer techniques, the old ones usually still work.\nConclusion #\rIn the end, FlexBox is just another tool in the shed. How, when, and why you use it don’t really matter if the end product is there. Just be mindful of what your needs actually are and to ensure that your code is readable and easy to maintain. The rest is icing on the cake.\nBesides, who doesn’t love doing some layouts in tables once in a while (just kidding).\n","date":"September 21 2022","permalink":"/posts/flexbox/","section":"Posts","summary":"At this point, I think we’ve all—those of us in the web development or web design world, at least—heard of a little thing called FlexBox.","title":"5 Things I’ve Learned About FlexBox"},{"content":"I haven\u0026rsquo;t been on a hike in an embarrassingly long time.

So, in an effort to change things up and keep myself excited about what I do, I have decided to learn something new.\nSince it\u0026rsquo;s been on my \u0026lsquo;Want to learn\u0026rsquo; list for a while, what better time to learn React.js! ⚛ I\u0026rsquo;ll be using Codecademy\u0026rsquo;s Learn React course to get started, and hope to at least build a couple of small apps to really get the hang of things. Maybe a game? We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nSwitching to Linux 🐧 #\rLinux is really cool, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to be giving it a more serious effort than in years past. With Valve putting tons of effort and resources into the Steam Deck and Proton, gaming on Linux has come a long way. And, of course, each new version of any popular GNU/Linux distribution brings with it cool new features while closing the gap between what Windows or macOS can do and what Linux can do. The fact that Linux has always been more friendly to developers was the main reason I got interested in Linux in the first place, but now it could truly put up a fight to become my daily driver. So, about a month ago, I decided to switch to Linux on both my laptop and my desktop.\nLaptop vs. desktop #\rSwitching on the laptop has been super easy. I chose Pop!_OS and installing it on my Thinkpad was a breeze. The only hardware related thing I needed to get working was the fingerprint sensor, which was fairly simple to do. Pop runs great on it, and for my relatively simple use cases, Linux can do everything I need and so much more.\nI have also been utilizing Pop!_OS on my desktop, but the results have been mixed. For the most part everything worked without a hitch, but gaming still isn\u0026rsquo;t quite there, in my opinion. That said, is it good enough? For me, yes. Of course, there are games or software that simply won\u0026rsquo;t run without causing headaches on Linux, so I have had to keep my expectations in check.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t at least tried Linux in some form, but have been either curious or just don\u0026rsquo;t like Windows, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend doing some research (I really can\u0026rsquo;t stress how important research is here) and then giving it a try. It\u0026rsquo;s very fun, rewarding, and I think you\u0026rsquo;d be surprised at how much more it can offer than Windows.\nThere may be future posts about Linux here. If that\u0026rsquo;s something you might be interested in, check back once in a while.\nThe beauty of post-apocalyptic Boston #\rI recently started a new play-through of Fallout 4, in which you explore a post-apocalyptic Boston in search of your lost son, and I forgot how beautiful the broken, decaying, harsh world of that game can be. It\u0026rsquo;s a heck of a lot of fun, and the graphics hold up very well.\nOne thing I\u0026rsquo;ve always really appreciated about Bethesda\u0026rsquo;s games is that they really suck you in to the world that they\u0026rsquo;ve built. The combat is usually a bit clunky, the characters often feel a little robotic or downright stupid, and the voice acting has, in my opinion, always been a bit lackluster. But these things bring with them their own unique charm. What\u0026rsquo;s amazing about these games is that, despite these shortcomings, there is a real sense of being a part of a greater whole\u0026hellip; That your actions, interactions, and decisions don\u0026rsquo;t just matter, but subtly fit themselves in to the greater story. You often feel insignificant, but you shape the world immensely.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s pretty beautiful.\n","date":"August 1 2022","permalink":"/posts/july-2022/","section":"Posts","summary":"Wow!

Spend a few hours listening to a few great podcasts and the reason for this becomes quite clear: podcasts are an amazing and simple way of hearing awesome stories, catching up on industry news, or exploring a new hobby. The amount of entertainment and information within the podcastsphere is seemingly endless… And that can be a bit intimidating.\nWith thousands of fantastic podcasts to choose from made by a huge variety of talented people with something to share, it can be difficult to know where to begin. My advice is always to first consider what you might want in a podcast and then search around for what people are recommending in that category. Looking for top notch storytelling with a spooky twist? Search for horror podcasts. Looking for deep dives into current events? There are plenty of podcasts that cover the news from a variety of perspectives. Want to learn more about gardening? A quick search in Overcast comes up with dozens. The important idea here is that with so many out there, part of the fun is exploring the different ideas and genres out there and finding the podcasts you really enjoy.\nWith that, I wanted to share the ten podcasts I am most looking forward to listening to more of in 2021. Podcasts I listen to fall into a range of topics and categories, and my top ten are no different. Note that these are my top ten podcasts, and my interests may not align with yours, but I hope you find something here that piques your interest.\nAlong with a short bit about each podcast and why I like them, I’ve also included whether or not I think they require listening from the first episode. I have put each pick into one of the following categories:\nNo: Jump right in! No episodes really require hearing another to start enjoying the podcast. Of course, feel free to scroll through the backlogs and listen to episodes that look interesting.\nMaybe: It depends. These podcasts might have several episodes that build off of each other, or include many different multi-episode stories. You’ll want to at least glance at the backlog to make sure you’re not missing out on anything interesting or important, and if the most recent episode is part of a series, go back and start from the beginning of that series. But, if you don’t care or don’t have the patience, you can also just listen to the latest episode and not feel too lost.\nYes: You will definitely want to start from episode one with these. What happens in episode 23 will likely be confusing or uninteresting without everything that came before it. These are likely story-driven podcasts more akin to listening to an audio book than reading an article in a magazine.\n10. Bananas #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nKurt Braunohler and Scotty Landes discuss the strange, fascinating, and just plain bananas news from around the world.\nThis is a podcast in which you truly never know what you are going to hear. Kurt and Scotty pull unexpected news from any and all sources ranging from the time a criminal tried to escape being caught using an underwater sea scooter to a man dressed as a cow stealing milk from Walmart. It can be a wild ride that may simultaneously be fascinating, hilarious, and horrifying. This podcast often features guests who are invited to come along for the ride.\nIf you think you’d enjoy a podcast that pokes fun at the extraordinary, but lesser-known, events happening every day, then this is a great place to start.\n9. The Candid Frame #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nEach week host Ibarionex Parello brings in-depth, intimate and thoughtful conversations with photographers on living a photographic life.\nIf you are at all interested in photography, let the deep, soothing voice of Ibarionex guide you through conversations with some of the worlds best photographers. Starring amazing guests from portrait photographers that shoot the worlds biggest celebrities to world-renowned fine art and landscape photographers, there is no shortage of amazing conversation and story in this podcast.\nIn The Candid Frame, Ibarionex gets personal with his guests, delving into their stories, backgrounds, and philosophies. While respectful, he challenges them to discuss the tougher aspects of their lives, art, or careers, often revealing the more human aspects of these fantastic artists you don’t see or hear day-to-day.\nIf you’ve ever wondered what some of the best photographers of today are really like or how they got to where they are, this is the podcast for you.\nOh yeah, and did I mention his voice?\n8. Supernatural With Ashley Flowers #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nMost mysteries can be solved by looking at the facts. But sometimes, the facts don’t lead to a logical explanation, and the truth lies somewhere in the unknown…\nIf you already have some experience with podcasts you may know about a podcast called Criminal. If not, Criminal, hosted by Phoebe Judge, is a true crime podcast in which Phoebe explores real crimes and often interviews those involved with the crime or with the criminals. It’s a fascinating look into real-world events which often seem more likely to have occurred in a TV show or fiction. It was also very close to making this list and is well-worth a listen.\nSupernatural is to unexplained events as Criminal is to true crime.\nIn each episode, Ashley Flowers explores an unexplained mystery you may, or may not, have heard of. Taking a deep-dive into the people and events surrounding these mysteries, Ashley unravels the stories and theories, attempting to reveal what really happened. Often, this only leads to more questions. The result is a podcast that is simultaneously exciting and unsettling.\nThis podcast offers a great introduction to the supernatural and/or true crime genres, and is a good place to start if you’re not sure whether or not you’ll like them.\n7. Sawbones: A Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nJoin Dr. Sydnee McElroy and her husband Justin McElroy for a tour of all the dumb, bad, gross, weird, and wrong ways we’ve tried to fix people.\nEver wonder what the miracle elixirs of yesteryear really were and how they came to be, or about the medical virtues of coffee, or maybe the how fluoride became both savior and villain at the same time? Dr. Sydnee and Justin explore topics like these and so much more in Sawbones. This is a podcast that I truly always look forward to, as the conversation is always either relevant to current events or just very interesting.\nDr. Sydnee brings the expertise while Justin brings the humor (anyone who has listened to the ever-popular My Brother My Brother and Me will know the name). The couple brings a fantastic, and often hilarious, dynamic to all sorts of medical-related topics. Surely this must be one of the only podcasts to combine this level of historical medical research with this kind of humor. If you know of another please let me know!\n6. Lore #\rListen from episode one? Maybe.\nFind it here.\nLore is a bi-weekly podcast about dark historical tales.\nThis is one of those podcasts I have been listening to since I started listening to podcasts years ago. Note that while this could be labeled No for listening from episode one, there are so many exceptional episodes in the backlog that I labeled it Maybe instead. Just know that if you don’t listen to past episodes, you’ll do just fine.\nIf you like stories about the supernatural and disconcerting experiences of real-life people throughout history, look no further than Lore. Host Aaron Mahnke has the unique ability to instill within the listener an uneasy doubt about their own realities. He doesn’t attempt to explain away the experiences of the characters in the stories he shares, but rather uses them as a platform to explore the human psyche and the often devastating effects it can have on our realities. If you only have one slot for a podcast in this genre, this could be the one to fill it.\nBefore jumping into his latest episodes, I highly recommend listening to episode 23: Rope and Railing. While the production was a bit dry back then, this episode has some fascinating exploration around lighthouses and the symbolism and mystery they can hold in our lives. It also serves as a great introduction to the type of content you can expect from Aaron.\n5. The Wild with Chris Morgan #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nTHE WILD with Chris Morgan explores how nature survives and thrives alongside (and often despite) humans.\nFrom bears to birds to serene soundscapes, this podcast encourages the listener to slip away into the great outdoors through audio. In it, Chris tells amazing stories from the wilder parts of the Pacific Northwest. Though the episodes are rarely very long, they always provide a nice break from the realities of day-to-day life.\nNot all episodes are strictly about wildlife… Or rather, some do involve humans. Chris will frequently bring the listener along on his travels to meet men and women who, like himself, have been drawn to the outdoors. Whether that be to see a rare bird or track endangered species, these are people that love the wild.\nIf you are a lover of the outdoors, or are just looking for a mental break from the busyness of life, this is a fantastic listen.\n4. My Brother My Brother and Me #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nAn advice podcast for the modren era. The McElroy brothers are here to take your questions and turn them, alchemy-like, into wisdom.\nIf that description sounds a little goofy to you, that’s because it is.\nReal-life brothers: Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy are a truly dynamic trio that can’t really seem to take anything seriously… And that’s a great thing, ‘cus it’s a comedy podcast!\nThe premise of this show is pretty simple: three brothers read questions found on Yahoo Answers and try to answer them. They do not, however, try to answer them in any sort of helpful manner, often giving advice that could be described as the opposite of helpful.The result is usually hilarious. I have, on more than one occasion, accidentally laughed out loud in the office listening to this podcast.\nNow, there are many many comedy podcasts, so you would be forgiven for wondering why this podcast from three random brothers might have a place this high on my list when several better-known comedians have their own. That is because they have built a platform that relates so well with us internet folk. More than just telling some good jokes, their whit and character has helped these three boys become some of the most beloved characters in the medium and even the internet, largely because of their ability to just think outside the box.\nSeriously, give them a shot. Though, note that the humor can be pretty crude, so sorry if that’s not your thing.\n3. Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies #\rListen from episode one? Yes.\nFind it here.\nDungeons and Daddies is an award-winning Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons podcast that started in January, 2019.\nDo you like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, or like the idea of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons? Do you have the sense of humor of a child? Do you love creative and unexpected storytelling? Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies fits all of these characteristics and more.\nWithout giving too much away, Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies takes the idea of a traditional Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons podcast and adds an odd twist: the main characters are all dads from the modern world. I know, not the most riveting premise, and I’ll admit I was hesitant. But, this has quickly become one of my favorites of the D\u0026amp;D podcasts I have tried, and it’s one of the few I’m sticking with for 2021/. The characters are unique and quirky, the story is compelling, and the whole show is extremely entertaining.\nIf you find that you like this genre, other D\u0026amp;D podcasts worth listening to:\nAdventure Zone\nSneak Attack\nCritical Role\nTotal Party Kill\n2. Fruitloops: Serial Killers of Color #\rListen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nFruitloops is a weekly podcast hosted by Wendy and Beth. We are two female true crime enthusiasts who aim to bring you the often-untold stories of crimes committed by serial killers of color.\nTrue crime podcasts really took off over the last couple of years, and while some of the classics are still around, like Criminal or My Favorite Murder, there are new up-and-comers all the time. Fruitloops is a new(ish) podcast all about serial killers of color.\nWendy and Beth were fans of true crime, but they noticed that mainstream media has largely historically ignored serial killers that weren’t white. In response to this, they started a podcast where they focus on diverse crime stories you probably haven’t heard before.\nAlongside these stories, Wendy and Beth frequently have conversations around race, personal safety, and current events. The two have a great dynamic that keeps the podcast both entertaining and informative.\nFair warning: true crime podcasts can get morbid.\n1. Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History #\rListen from episode one? Maybe.\nFind it here.\nHow did a multi-hour long show that consists of nothing more than a host talking about history ever become wildly popular? It’s got something to do with Dan Carlin.\nThe title really (almost) says it all. Dan Carlin talks about historical events in great detail.\nBut that really doesn’t do it justice.\nTopics tend to center in on a specific scope of history. For example: in the first episode of his series Blueprint for Armageddon, Dan focuses in on the largely unknown literal and figurative trigger that led to World War I. He then, over the course of several multi-hour (often three or four hour) long episodes, explores the entire chain of events that follow. From the difficult political games world leaders are forced into, to journal entries from those in the field of history’s most horrific battlefields, Carlin focuses on the extremes of the human experience, and the wonder of how tiny decisions in the grand scheme of time can have long, widespread, and often devastating consequences.\nThere is a weight to the stories, when Dan tells them, that you don’t get in history textbooks.\nIf you are at all interested in history, the intricate balancing act of politics, or the amazing impact single individuals can have on the world, then Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History is one of the most rewarding podcasts you can listen to.\nQuick note: only some of the most recent series are available for free in regular podcast players, but if you find that you enjoy his content the archived series are well worth the cost. In fact, I have paid for some to listen again.\nI hope you explore some of these and find some joy in them.\nDo you have a top ten or fifteen or twenty podcasts you are looking forward to most in 2021? Let me know! I’m always looking for more.\n","date":"January 22 2021","permalink":"/posts/top-podcasts-2021/","section":"Posts","summary":"My Top Ten Podcasts for 2021 #\rPodcasts have exploded in the last few years, and I have no doubt that 2021 will see that trend continue.","title":"Top Podcasts 2021"},{"content":"Why I got into photography #\rOf all the artistic mediums that I’ve tried, only one has stuck with me as something that I truly love: photography. I love photography. I also have an immense appreciation for film. And now, I’m going to delve into why that is, and maybe it will spark an interest in someone new!\nI first got into photography in high-school. Like many things in my life, I got the idea to try out photography from my older brother. I often followed my brother’s footsteps, though I’ve never excelled at any one thing quite as well as he had. Ah, well, that is something I can live with, because so many of these things have brought me so much joy and satisfaction. I picked up a few hobbies due to my brother: percussion, BMX, my early preferences in music, the Zelda series, the list goes on… But I don’t think any of them have stuck with me quite as much as photography has.\n“It is difficult to pick up my camera to shoot a scene and not think of that.\nThis puts a lot of personal and nostalgic weight on the medium for me. It’s something that I attribute to my past and to my relationship with my brother. It is difficult to pick up my camera to shoot a scene and not think of that. It’s small but it’s one aspect of the medium that’s continued to draw me back.\nBeing creative #\rIt’s also one of the few mediums I’ve gotten to be half-way decent at, and one that didn’t require hours upon hours of physically and emotionally draining work to feel confident at (percussion or drawing can certainly have their moments). I always wanted to be creative-I wanted to be an artist as a child-and photography is a creative outlet that has clicked with me and doesn’t require putting in the hours of a second job.\nPhotography and philosophy #\rThe idea of photography is also utterly fascinating to me. No other medium lets us snatch up a moment of reality, of time, and preserve it like photography does. There is a lot of power in that. In my junior year, I wrote a response to Susan Sontag’s On Photography, a fabulous exploration of the meaning and potential consequences of photography, and its increasing accessibility over time. If you’d like to read my response, it can be found here. I recommend reading the book first, however.\n“This way of quickly and easily documenting time and reality is incredible and unprecedented…\nOne more reason I am fascinated by photography is that it, like many creative mediums, is consequential. It is meaningful. And it is these things without having to be “good.” An image holds a lot of weight, even if it is just a snap that you’ve thrown on to Facebook. You have literally captured a moment of time and archived it. You’ve preserved your perspective of something and shown it to all else to see as you’ve seen it. It is incredibly intimate and can quickly be seen as invasive. This way of quickly and easily documenting time and reality is incredible and unprecedented in the majority of human history.\nSo that’s a bit about why I love photography so much, but why film? What is it about that old, outdated model of taking photos that appeals to me?\nBut why film? #\rThe main answer you’d probably hear to that question is that film has a certain amount of nostalgia to it. The photos just ooze 1970’s. This is certainly true, but I think it’s more than that.\nNostalgia\u0026hellip; But more? #\rI grew up around film, and yet my first few years of taking photos were all digital. Film is interesting to me partially because it’s a bit foreign. It’s kind of new, and it seems it’s taking longer for it to lose that feel.\nNow, because I grew up around film, there is a bit of nostalgia around it. But it’s not usually the images that create that for me, it’s the film itself. I would often go with my mother to drop off or pick up the film from the last few weeks of photos. It was a fun experience, and I guess it still is (though, I go on my own and take my own photos these days).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tangible #\rAnother reason I like film is due to its tangibility. It’s nice to load and unload the film. It’s fun to look at the little images on the negatives you get back from the lab. The cameras are more of an experience to use, too. My Canon AE-1 requires shooting in manual. Its body is metal, the mechanics are heavy and audible. The sound of that shutter, or the film advancing, is so satisfying! You could make an argument that using a “better,” digital, camera will allow you to take better photographs by removing itself from between you and your subject. Its strength is largely in its ease of use. However, there’s something so much more substantial about using something a little chunky, a little cumbersome.\nSlowing down #\rOne more aspect of shooting film that digital can’t provide is time. Between loading a roll of film, shooting it (you should be taking your time with your shots, as you have far fewer with film), unloading it, and finally, developing it, there’s a lot of time that goes into far fewer shots. There’s something nice about that. Slowing down a bit. Focusing on what you’re doing to make sure your exposures are good and your image is in focus. The anticipation when waiting to get your film back from the lab. It all adds up to a much more interesting and exciting experience.\n“Time, cost, sometimes frustration, these all mean I am more intentional about taking photos…\nSummary #\rTo sum up all those things into one overall reason that I love film: it is intentional. Time, cost, sometimes frustration, these all mean I am more intentional abut taking photos. It makes me slow down and think about what I’m doing, and I really like that. I have to do most things fast. I’m always trying to be more productive, more efficient, but film helps me get away from the hectic tendencies of day-to-day life. That’s part of why I’ve started using fountain pens, started writing by hand again, ride my bike more (when I’m not being lazy), etc. As the number of things I need to do each day goes up, I have to find joy and peace in doing those things. Film let’s me enjoy taking photos just a bit more.\nAnyways, I love photography. I love film. And I love sharing those things. Do you have anything that you love that might seem impractical? Do you love something, are fascinated by something? I hope so. It makes life just that much more enjoyable.\n","date":"June 7 2018","permalink":"/posts/film-photography/","section":"Posts","summary":"Why I got into photography #\rOf all the artistic mediums that I’ve tried, only one has stuck with me as something that I truly love: photography.","title":"Film Photography"},{"content":"Part 2: Installing Hugo #\rIntro #\rAlright, so you’re excited about creating your new website and you’re excited to give Hugo a try. Fair enough! Let’s jump right into it!\nA couple things to note, though, before we get started. If you are looking for the simplest and quickest way to get Hugo up and running, look no further than Hugo’s own docs. They are fairly easy to read, and are great if you’re just looking to get into it as quickly as possible. For me, quick start guide only got me so far, left me with a lot of questions, and didn’t actually work. My goal here is flesh out some of those questions, as well as provides answers for some of the issues I ran into, just in case someone else does.\nIt’s also worth noting that while I work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, I’ve only used Hugo on Linux, so that’s what you’ll see here. If you’ve got another OS, things shouldn’t be too different (depending on what you’ve got installed), and Google should be able to get you to where you need to go.\nInstallation #\rInstallation with Hugo is (mostly) a breeze. Following the instructions on their quick start guide seems to work pretty well, with one caviat that I found-more on that later.\nThe terminal #\rTo start off, open your terminal/console of choice. I use the built-in terminal that comes with Ubuntu, my Linux flavor of choice. Using the built-in terminal on macOS should work just as well, though I believe you need Homebrew installed. Windows users will want to follow the steps mentioned here. Once you’re in your console, make sure that you’re not in the wrong folder by typing:\n~$ cd\rNow, on Linux all you have to do is type:\n~$ sudo apt-get install hugo\rThis should do it for Ubuntu/Debian users. Go ahead and follow the instructions in their docs if you’re using a different operating system.\nOnce complete, go ahead and type: hugo version to double check that the installation worked. It should show something like this:\nThe version problem #\rOne of the issues I ran into with Hugo was with installation. Or rather, it was with installing a theme. That in itself is an easy enough task, but if you look at a theme here, you’ll see that on the left-hand side, it shows a minimum Hugo version. This is the minimum version of Hugo that you need installed in order to use that particular theme.\nThat’s all well and good, but installing Hugo by following the instructions in their docs should install the latest stable version, so that any theme can be used, right? Wrong. When I installed Hugo using the apt-get command, it installed version 0.16, or something like that. This only allowed me to use a small handful of themes, and there is no way to sort them by minimum version support.\nAfter some digging, I found that you can manually install the latest and greatest Hugo version by using the appropriate link from this page. This is pretty typical for installing stored on GitHub, but as someone who is fairly new to all of this, it was a bit confusing and frustrating.\nTo do this (again, on Ubuntu Linux), simply right-click the appropriate link, in my case the one that ends with Linux_64bit.deb, and put the following in a fresh console:\n~$ sudo wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.37.1/hugo_0.37.1_Linux-64bit.deb\rObviously replace that long url with the one you just copied. By the way, if you’re like me, you’re probably wondering how to paste something into a terminal. Well, usually it’s ctrl+shift+v. Now that we’ve downloaded the newest release of Hugo, let’s unpack it using the following:\n~$ sudo dpkg -i hugo*.deb\rNow, running hugo version should return the version number that you just installed.\nIf you’re still not seeing the right version of Hugo, I recommend turning to the good people of the internet to help solve the issue, but if you’re on Linux, and you followed all the above steps, you shouldn’t really have any issues.\nCreating your site #\rNow it’s time to create your site. With Hugo, this is very, very easy. It actually only takes a single command. But before we do that, let’s make sure you’re putting that site where you want it!\nFolder structure #\rCreate a folder where you want the site to be either in a finder/explorer window, or in your console. Either way, you’ll need to navigate to that folder in your console, so I find it’s easier to just mkdir there. If you’re new to the console and aren’t sure how to navigate, here’s a decent resource to get you started.\nKeep in mind that when you create your site, it will create it within a folder with the name of… well, whatever you name your site. So, if you’re making a blog site and you want it to be within your Documents/sites folder, just stay in the sites folder. No need to create one called blog.\nOnce you’re inside the folder you want to store the site in, we’ll use the following command:\nhugo new site blog\rInstead of blog, use whatever name you want to identify your site. This will create a new folder with all of the necessary files. So, if we type ls you should see your new site folder listed.\nThat’s it.\nPicking \u0026amp; installing a theme #\rFor most themes, to install, you’re really just going to clone a GitHub repo into your themes folder. So, first things first, cd into your site folder. In my case that would be\ncd blog\rNow, go to the hugo themes site, and pick one. Remember how I made a big deal about how apt-get install hugo didn’t install the latest version? That’s because most of these themes will require a much later version of Hugo than what it initially installed.\nAnyways, pick a theme-I really like Kiss for a super simple blog-and click on the Download button.\nYou’ll want to look for the big green “Clone or Download” button on the themes GitHub page. Click that, and then copy the URL.\nNow go back to your console.\nFirst, we need to initialize Git in your site folder. It’s pretty simple, just git init. If you don’t have Git installed, go ahead and install it first. Then, we want to tell Git to clone and download the theme files into the appropriate folder. By telling it to put the theme in themes/kiss it will automatically create the folder for me.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/ribice/kiss.git themes/kiss\rLet it do its thing. It should look something like this.\nSetting the theme #\rOnce that’s done, you’ve pretty much installed a theme. You’ll need to tell your site to use the theme, especially if you have multiple themes installed (which you can totally do). The first thing you’ll want to do is add the theme to your config.toml file. This is where a lot of basic information for your site will go. Being a .toml file, it’s a sort of database for Hugo to pull information from when it’s building your site later on. Once you’ve downloaded and decided on a theme, go ahead and add it to your config.toml file: theme = \u0026quot;themeName\u0026quot;.\nIf you’ve installed multiple themes, and you want to try some different ones, you can use -t to tell Hugo which theme to use when building your site. In a bit, we’ll go over how to view your site on Hugo’s built-in local server, which is a great way to view and try different themes locally.\nAdding some content #\rRight now, you’ve got a site with a theme, but nothing else. Let’s make a new blog post to test out how the site looks.\nhugo new posts/test.md\rThis tells Hugo to create a new post called test.md. .md files are Markdown files. Markdown is a great way to quickly and easily write content for the web. It has it’s own, simple, syntax, and then Hugo will spit that out at HTML in your site files. It’s worth learning a bit of Markdown to make writing your posts easy (and honestly quite fun).\nGo ahead and open your new Markdown file in your favorite text editor. It will be in the posts folder within your site folder. The first thing you’ll see is a bit of metadata that Hugo automatically added to the top of the file. For now, let’s just leave that as-is.\nGo ahead and add some text underneath that metadata-after the second set of dashes-and then save the file.\nCongrats! You just added some content to your site!\nViewing the site locally using the Hugo server #\rHead back over to your console, and make sure that you’re in your site folder. If you’ve done everything the way I’ve described, you should already be there, but it never hurts to make sure. Whenever you’re working on your site, and you want to view it in the broswer locally, you’ll use the Hugo server. This is the built-in local server that comes with Hugo, and it makes it super easy to build and view your site with one simple command.\nhugo server\rThat’s it.\nNow you can go to http://localhost:1313/ to view your site. However, if you left the metadata on your test.md file alone, you’re probably not seeing that post. That’s because Hugo creates a new post as a draft by default, and running the server normally will ignore drafts. To see your drafts as well, all you have to do is add -D after the server command. First, cancel the current instance of the server using ctrl+c. Then:\nhugo server -D\rNow you should be able to refresh the site and see your post! It will likely say “:Draft” after it, letting you know that it’s a draft.\nTo view your site with different themes, simply do like this:\nhugo server -t themeName\rFun fact: Hugo server has an auto-refresh feature, so if you make a change to your posts while it’s running, your changes will appear as soon as you save the file. No need to refresh! It’s pretty great, but I have had instances when I needed to refresh the page a few times to see a bigger styling change or the like.\nGo Have Fun! #\rFrom here, go ahead and play around! If you want to do something specific with the site, Hugo’s own docs are a great resource, but there are plenty of people out there who know what they’re doing, and more than willing to help.\nHosting Your Hugo Site Online #\rSimply run the hugo command within in your site folder to build the site. This will create a folder called public, which contains all the normal site files in .html, .css, etc.\nThere are various ways to host a Hugo site. I personally host mine on GitHub Pages. I found this guide to be extremely helpful for getting that working (along with a lot of trial and error). You could upload files via ftp. Whatever you feel comfortable with.\nI hope that you’re finding as much joy in building with Hugo as I have. It’s allowed me to quickly, easily, and enjoyably build static websites, even on a busy schedule. I can’t wait to build something else!\n","date":"May 9 2018","permalink":"/posts/hugo-blog-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"Part 2: Installing Hugo #\rIntro #\rAlright, so you’re excited about creating your new website and you’re excited to give Hugo a try.","title":"Spinning Up a Hugo Blog - Part 2"},{"content":"Or, How I Made This Blog #\rI’ve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant. For one reason or another, I just didn’t feel like I should. This was of course silly, especially given the number of articles out there that make it clear, the best way to start a blog is to start one.\nChoosing a tech stack #\rOne of the main reasons I never started one was because I wanted to make a blog site that was custom, easy to use, and fast. In the past, any sites I’ve made have been made completely static using good ‘ol HTML \u0026amp; CSS. Somewhat recently, however, I had to get used to the idea of using WordPress for my new job. Not only did I discover that WordPress isn’t as terrible as I always imagined, it can be kind of fun! But that didn’t change my mind about using it for a blog-it’s just too heavy for something so simple.\nFor a while I thought my only options were to manually create, organize, and style my pages, or to use some sort of templating tool. A blog didn’t seem like it was worth the work of doing everything manually, and I was too lacking in web dev finesse to want to mess with template systems or the like.\nLearning about static site generators #\rI’ve been listening to The Shop Talk Show for a while now, and there was one episode where Dave Rupert was talking about this thing that could make static websites by just running a few commands in a console. This was well before I had spent much time in a console, but that sounded cool! It also sounded like exactly what I’d want to use for a simple blog. (Only) a couple of years later, and I decided to give it a try.\nIf you are a listener of that wonderful podcast, or you’ve spent more than a few months in the web dev community, you can probably guess what I’m talking about. It is, of course, Jekyll. If you didn’t know that, or don’t know much about it, Jekyll is what is called a static site generator. Basically, a static site generator is a program that uses a database to take a bunch of random (well, not really) files and smash them together into a fully functional website. Jekyll is likely the most well known and loved static site generator out there today.\nHowever, even Jekyll turned out to be more complicated than what I wanted. Jekyll is very, very cool, and is surprisingly good at scaling to different needs. And while there are certainly easier ways of getting a site up and running with Jekyll, I’ve found myself more and more enjoying my time in the console, and wanted to be able to do things quickly and easily there, without having to spend hours learning, installing dependencies, troubleshooting, etc.\nFinding Hugo #\rAfter a bit of searching around, I came across Hugo. Hugo is also a static site generator, but it’s a bit… lighter. After a bit of research this seemed like the perfect option for me and my new blog. It’s extremely easy to install, run, and works quite well with Github Pages, which is what I wanted to use to host my blog. Getting the blog live on Pages was far and away more difficult than building a site with Hugo, and you really only to set it up once to get things working. Now, all I really need to do is write a post using beautiful Markdown, and push to Github. That’s. It.\nSo, here we are, Hugo + Github Pages (and a custom domain) and I’ve got my ideal blogging solution that will allow me to expand a bit here and there as I go, without having to really worry about much else.\nPart 2 #\rJoin me in Part 2 to see how to install and get started with Hugo.\n","date":"April 17 2018","permalink":"/posts/hugo-blog/","section":"Posts","summary":"Or, How I Made This Blog #\rI’ve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant.","title":"Spinning Up a Hugo Blog - Part 1"},{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s going on here? #\rI write about my interests. #\rAs of right now, that is really about the gist of it! I’ve wanted to start a blog for a long time. However, I never really thought I had anything worth sharing. And, honestly, not much has changed. One thing that has changed, though, is my perspective on whether or not that matters. Turns out, it doesn’t. But something does…\nA confession #\rI have a confession: I hated writing papers in high-school. When I had to, I gave minimal effort, minimal interest, and didn’t think twice about the fact that I believed these papers were meaningless. This was largely my own fault. I’ve never been a terribly motivated person, and homework brought out this trait of mine doubly so.\nMy environment didn’t help all that much, though, either. I was never taught the joy of writing. I never witnessed that conveying something interesting or important to yourself or others through the written word can be enjoyable, satisfying, and rewarding.\nSo how and when did that part of me change? Probably in my sophomore year in college. I went to a general education college with a focus in graphic design. One of the required courses for all students was an English class. It turned out that the class largely focused on writing papers. I was not excited.\nBut what was different about that class from what I received in high-school? I’m quite positive I’ve figured out how to answer that question, and I’ll admit that it took me a while. I’m quite sure it all comes down to interest. Nothing in this world can quite feel meaningful or worthwhile without some amount of interest, whether that is in regards to something you are doing, making, reading, consuming, or writing.\nNow, when I started that class, I didn’t go into it with interest. No, I was going to treat this class like all of my other English courses. I was going to cruise through this class with minimal effort and a satisfactory grade. No, this time it all came down to my professor. Sure, he was passionate about writing, but I sure wasn’t, and no amount of kind words towards the activity were going to change my mind. However, what he did do differently than my past teachers, even if the topic I was writing about was absolutely ridiculous (\u0026quot;Is McDonald’s Really That Bad?\u0026quot;), was that he showed interest in my topics and my writing, despite my lack of it. He asked questions about how writing was going. He gave suggestions on where and how to research beyond the usual “go to the library”. He not only let me know what I was doing wrong when proofing my papers, but also remarked on things he found interesting about how I phrased something or a bit of research I found. He read into things that I didn’t even mean to be there, which made me interested in my own writing! Essentially, he made writing those papers feel worthwhile, because I found that someone, even myself sometimes, was actually getting something out of reading them.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve been craving that feeling ever since\u0026hellip; I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know it yet.\nMaking it happen #\rSo here’s what I’m doing with this blog. I’m writing for the fun of it. I’m writing about my interests because that makes writing interesting. And rather than relying on a professor’s feedback to keep me motivated to keep writing, I think that my own interest will be enough to keep writing. And if you find any interest while reading what I write, well then that’s just icing on the cake, isn’t it?\n","date":"March 22 2018","permalink":"/posts/blog-intro/","section":"Posts","summary":"What\u0026rsquo;s going on here?","title":"Baby's First Blog Post"},{"content":"","date":"January 1 0001","permalink":"/work/","section":"","summary":"","title":"My Work History"}]
