Spend a few hours listening to a few great podcasts and the reason for this becomes quite clear: podcasts are an amazing and simple way of hearing awesome stories, catching up on industry news, or exploring a new hobby. The amount of entertainment and information within the podcastsphere is seemingly endless… And that can be a bit intimidating.\nWith thousands of fantastic podcasts to choose from made by a huge variety of talented people with something to share, it can be difficult to know where to begin. My advice is always to first consider what you might want in a podcast and then search around for what people are recommending in that category. Looking for top notch storytelling with a spooky twist? Search for horror podcasts. Looking for deep dives into current events? There are plenty of podcasts that cover the news from a variety of perspectives. Want to learn more about gardening? A quick search in Overcast comes up with dozens. The important idea here is that with so many out there, part of the fun is exploring the different ideas and genres out there and finding the podcasts you really enjoy.\nWith that, I wanted to share the ten podcasts I am most looking forward to listening to more of in 2021. Podcasts I listen to fall into a range of topics and categories, and my top ten are no different. Note that these are my top ten podcasts, and my interests may not align with yours, but I hope you find something here that piques your interest.\nAlong with a short bit about each podcast and why I like them, I’ve also included whether or not I think they require listening from the first episode. I have put each pick into one of the following categories:\nNo: Jump right in! No episodes really require hearing another to start enjoying the podcast. Of course, feel free to scroll through the backlogs and listen to episodes that look interesting.\nMaybe: It depends. These podcasts might have several episodes that build off of each other, or include many different multi-episode stories. You’ll want to at least glance at the backlog to make sure you’re not missing out on anything interesting or important, and if the most recent episode is part of a series, go back and start from the beginning of that series. But, if you don’t care or don’t have the patience, you can also just listen to the latest episode and not feel too lost.\nYes: You will definitely want to start from episode one with these. What happens in episode 23 will likely be confusing or uninteresting without everything that came before it. These are likely story-driven podcasts more akin to listening to an audio book than reading an article in a magazine.\n10. Bananas # Listen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nKurt Braunohler and Scotty Landes discuss the strange, fascinating, and just plain bananas news from around the world.\nThis is a podcast in which you truly never know what you are going to hear. Kurt and Scotty pull unexpected news from any and all sources ranging from the time a criminal tried to escape being caught using an underwater sea scooter to a man dressed as a cow stealing milk from Walmart. It can be a wild ride that may simultaneously be fascinating, hilarious, and horrifying. This podcast often features guests who are invited to come along for the ride.\nIf you think you’d enjoy a podcast that pokes fun at the extraordinary, but lesser-known, events happening every day, then this is a great place to start.\n9. The Candid Frame # Listen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nEach week host Ibarionex Parello brings in-depth, intimate and thoughtful conversations with photographers on living a photographic life.\nIf you are at all interested in photography, let the deep, soothing voice of Ibarionex guide you through conversations with some of the worlds best photographers. Starring amazing guests from portrait photographers that shoot the worlds biggest celebrities to world-renowned fine art and landscape photographers, there is no shortage of amazing conversation and story in this podcast.\nIn The Candid Frame, Ibarionex gets personal with his guests, delving into their stories, backgrounds, and philosophies. While respectful, he challenges them to discuss the tougher aspects of their lives, art, or careers, often revealing the more human aspects of these fantastic artists you don’t see or hear day-to-day.\nIf you’ve ever wondered what some of the best photographers of today are really like or how they got to where they are, this is the podcast for you.\nOh yeah, and did I mention his voice?\n8. Supernatural With Ashley Flowers # Listen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nMost mysteries can be solved by looking at the facts. But sometimes, the facts don’t lead to a logical explanation, and the truth lies somewhere in the unknown…\nIf you already have some experience with podcasts you may know about a podcast called Criminal. If not, Criminal, hosted by Phoebe Judge, is a true crime podcast in which Phoebe explores real crimes and often interviews those involved with the crime or with the criminals. It’s a fascinating look into real-world events which often seem more likely to have occurred in a TV show or fiction. It was also very close to making this list and is well-worth a listen.\nSupernatural is to unexplained events as Criminal is to true crime.\nIn each episode, Ashley Flowers explores an unexplained mystery you may, or may not, have heard of. Taking a deep-dive into the people and events surrounding these mysteries, Ashley unravels the stories and theories, attempting to reveal what really happened. Often, this only leads to more questions. The result is a podcast that is simultaneously exciting and unsettling.\nThis podcast offers a great introduction to the supernatural and/or true crime genres, and is a good place to start if you’re not sure whether or not you’ll like them.\n7. Sawbones: A Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine # Listen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nJoin Dr. Sydnee McElroy and her husband Justin McElroy for a tour of all the dumb, bad, gross, weird, and wrong ways we’ve tried to fix people.\nEver wonder what the miracle elixirs of yesteryear really were and how they came to be, or about the medical virtues of coffee, or maybe the how fluoride became both savior and villain at the same time? Dr. Sydnee and Justin explore topics like these and so much more in Sawbones. This is a podcast that I truly always look forward to, as the conversation is always either relevant to current events or just very interesting.\nDr. Sydnee brings the expertise while Justin brings the humor (anyone who has listened to the ever-popular My Brother My Brother and Me will know the name). The couple brings a fantastic, and often hilarious, dynamic to all sorts of medical-related topics. Surely this must be one of the only podcasts to combine this level of historical medical research with this kind of humor. If you know of another please let me know!\n6. Lore # Listen from episode one? Maybe.\nFind it here.\nLore is a bi-weekly podcast about dark historical tales.\nThis is one of those podcasts I have been listening to since I started listening to podcasts years ago. Note that while this could be labeled No for listening from episode one, there are so many exceptional episodes in the backlog that I labeled it Maybe instead. Just know that if you don’t listen to past episodes, you’ll do just fine.\nIf you like stories about the supernatural and disconcerting experiences of real-life people throughout history, look no further than Lore. Host Aaron Mahnke has the unique ability to instill within the listener an uneasy doubt about their own realities. He doesn’t attempt to explain away the experiences of the characters in the stories he shares, but rather uses them as a platform to explore the human psyche and the often devastating effects it can have on our realities. If you only have one slot for a podcast in this genre, this could be the one to fill it.\nBefore jumping into his latest episodes, I highly recommend listening to episode 23: Rope and Railing. While the production was a bit dry back then, this episode has some fascinating exploration around lighthouses and the symbolism and mystery they can hold in our lives. It also serves as a great introduction to the type of content you can expect from Aaron.\n5. The Wild with Chris Morgan # Listen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nTHE WILD with Chris Morgan explores how nature survives and thrives alongside (and often despite) humans.\nFrom bears to birds to serene soundscapes, this podcast encourages the listener to slip away into the great outdoors through audio. In it, Chris tells amazing stories from the wilder parts of the Pacific Northwest. Though the episodes are rarely very long, they always provide a nice break from the realities of day-to-day life.\nNot all episodes are strictly about wildlife… Or rather, some do involve humans. Chris will frequently bring the listener along on his travels to meet men and women who, like himself, have been drawn to the outdoors. Whether that be to see a rare bird or track endangered species, these are people that love the wild.\nIf you are a lover of the outdoors, or are just looking for a mental break from the busyness of life, this is a fantastic listen.\n4. My Brother My Brother and Me # Listen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nAn advice podcast for the modren era. The McElroy brothers are here to take your questions and turn them, alchemy-like, into wisdom.\nIf that description sounds a little goofy to you, that’s because it is.\nReal-life brothers: Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy are a truly dynamic trio that can’t really seem to take anything seriously… And that’s a great thing, ‘cus it’s a comedy podcast!\nThe premise of this show is pretty simple: three brothers read questions found on Yahoo Answers and try to answer them. They do not, however, try to answer them in any sort of helpful manner, often giving advice that could be described as the opposite of helpful.The result is usually hilarious. I have, on more than one occasion, accidentally laughed out loud in the office listening to this podcast.\nNow, there are many many comedy podcasts, so you would be forgiven for wondering why this podcast from three random brothers might have a place this high on my list when several better-known comedians have their own. That is because they have built a platform that relates so well with us internet folk. More than just telling some good jokes, their whit and character has helped these three boys become some of the most beloved characters in the medium and even the internet, largely because of their ability to just think outside the box.\nSeriously, give them a shot. Though, note that the humor can be pretty crude, so sorry if that’s not your thing.\n3. Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies # Listen from episode one? Yes.\nFind it here.\nDungeons and Daddies is an award-winning Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons podcast that started in January, 2019.\nDo you like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, or like the idea of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons? Do you have the sense of humor of a child? Do you love creative and unexpected storytelling? Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies fits all of these characteristics and more.\nWithout giving too much away, Dungeons \u0026amp; Daddies takes the idea of a traditional Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons podcast and adds an odd twist: the main characters are all dads from the modern world. I know, not the most riveting premise, and I’ll admit I was hesitant. But, this has quickly become one of my favorites of the D\u0026amp;D podcasts I have tried, and it’s one of the few I’m sticking with for 2021/. The characters are unique and quirky, the story is compelling, and the whole show is extremely entertaining.\nIf you find that you like this genre, other D\u0026amp;D podcasts worth listening to:\nAdventure Zone\nSneak Attack Critical RoleTotal Party Kill\n2. Fruitloops: Serial Killers of Color # Listen from episode one? No.\nFind it here.\nFruitloops is a weekly podcast hosted by Wendy and Beth. We are two female true crime enthusiasts who aim to bring you the often-untold stories of crimes committed by serial killers of color.\nTrue crime podcasts really took off over the last couple of years, and while some of the classics are still around, like Criminal or My Favorite Murder, there are new up-and-comers all the time. Fruitloops is a new(ish) podcast all about serial killers of color.\nWendy and Beth were fans of true crime, but they noticed that mainstream media has largely historically ignored serial killers that weren’t white. In response to this, they started a podcast where they focus on diverse crime stories you probably haven’t heard before.\nAlongside these stories, Wendy and Beth frequently have conversations around race, personal safety, and current events. The two have a great dynamic that keeps the podcast both entertaining and informative.\nFair warning: true crime podcasts can get morbid.\n1. Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History # Listen from episode one? Maybe.\nFind it here.\nHow did a multi-hour long show that consists of nothing more than a host talking about history ever become wildly popular? It’s got something to do with Dan Carlin.\nThe title really (almost) says it all. Dan Carlin talks about historical events in great detail.\nBut that really doesn’t do it justice.\nTopics tend to center in on a specific scope of history. For example: in the first episode of his series Blueprint for Armageddon, Dan focuses in on the largely unknown literal and figurative trigger that led to World War I. He then, over the course of several multi-hour (often three or four hour) long episodes, explores the entire chain of events that follow. From the difficult political games world leaders are forced into, to journal entries from those in the field of history’s most horrific battlefields, Carlin focuses on the extremes of the human experience, and the wonder of how tiny decisions in the grand scheme of time can have long, widespread, and often devastating consequences.\nThere is a weight to the stories, when Dan tells them, that you don’t get in history textbooks.\nIf you are at all interested in history, the intricate balancing act of politics, or the amazing impact single individuals can have on the world, then Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History is one of the most rewarding podcasts you can listen to.\nQuick note: only some of the most recent series are available for free in regular podcast players, but if you find that you enjoy his content the archived series are well worth the cost. In fact, I have paid for some to listen again.\nI hope you explore some of these and find some joy in them.\nDo you have a top ten or fifteen or twenty podcasts you are looking forward to most in 2021? Let me know! I’m always looking for more.\n","date":"January 22 2021","permalink":"/posts/top-podcasts-2021/","section":"Posts","summary":"My Top Ten Podcasts for 2021 # Podcasts have exploded in the last few years, and I have no doubt that 2021 will see that trend continue.","title":"Top Podcasts 2021"},{"content":"Why I got into photography # Of all the artistic mediums that I’ve tried, only one has stuck with me as something that I truly love: photography. I love photography. I also have an immense appreciation for film. And now, I’m going to delve into why that is, and maybe it will spark an interest in someone new!\nI first got into photography in high-school. Like many things in my life, I got the idea to try out photography from my older brother. I often followed my brother’s footsteps, though I’ve never excelled at any one thing quite as well as he had. Ah, well, that is something I can live with, because so many of these things have brought me so much joy and satisfaction. I picked up a few hobbies due to my brother: percussion, BMX, my early preferences in music, the Zelda series, the list goes on… But I don’t think any of them have stuck with me quite as much as photography has.\n“It is difficult to pick up my camera to shoot a scene and not think of that.\nThis puts a lot of personal and nostalgic weight on the medium for me. It’s something that I attribute to my past and to my relationship with my brother. It is difficult to pick up my camera to shoot a scene and not think of that. It’s small but it’s one aspect of the medium that’s continued to draw me back.\nBeing creative # It’s also one of the few mediums I’ve gotten to be half-way decent at, and one that didn’t require hours upon hours of physically and emotionally draining work to feel confident at (percussion or drawing can certainly have their moments). I always wanted to be creative-I wanted to be an artist as a child-and photography is a creative outlet that has clicked with me and doesn’t require putting in the hours of a second job.\nPhotography and philosophy # The idea of photography is also utterly fascinating to me. No other medium lets us snatch up a moment of reality, of time, and preserve it like photography does. There is a lot of power in that. In my junior year, I wrote a response to Susan Sontag’s On Photography, a fabulous exploration of the meaning and potential consequences of photography, and its increasing accessibility over time. If you’d like to read my response, it can be found here. I recommend reading the book first, however.\n“This way of quickly and easily documenting time and reality is incredible and unprecedented…\nOne more reason I am fascinated by photography is that it, like many creative mediums, is consequential. It is meaningful. And it is these things without having to be “good.” An image holds a lot of weight, even if it is just a snap that you’ve thrown on to Facebook. You have literally captured a moment of time and archived it. You’ve preserved your perspective of something and shown it to all else to see as you’ve seen it. It is incredibly intimate and can quickly be seen as invasive. This way of quickly and easily documenting time and reality is incredible and unprecedented in the majority of human history.\nSo that’s a bit about why I love photography so much, but why film? What is it about that old, outdated model of taking photos that appeals to me?\nBut why film? # The main answer you’d probably hear to that question is that film has a certain amount of nostalgia to it. The photos just ooze 1970’s. This is certainly true, but I think it’s more than that.\nNostalgia\u0026hellip; But more? # I grew up around film, and yet my first few years of taking photos were all digital. Film is interesting to me partially because it’s a bit foreign. It’s kind of new, and it seems it’s taking longer for it to lose that feel.\nNow, because I grew up around film, there is a bit of nostalgia around it. But it’s not usually the images that create that for me, it’s the film itself. I would often go with my mother to drop off or pick up the film from the last few weeks of photos. It was a fun experience, and I guess it still is (though, I go on my own and take my own photos these days).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tangible # Another reason I like film is due to its tangibility. It’s nice to load and unload the film. It’s fun to look at the little images on the negatives you get back from the lab. The cameras are more of an experience to use, too. My Canon AE-1 requires shooting in manual. Its body is metal, the mechanics are heavy and audible. The sound of that shutter, or the film advancing, is so satisfying! You could make an argument that using a “better,” digital, camera will allow you to take better photographs by removing itself from between you and your subject. Its strength is largely in its ease of use. However, there’s something so much more substantial about using something a little chunky, a little cumbersome.\nSlowing down # One more aspect of shooting film that digital can’t provide is time. Between loading a roll of film, shooting it (you should be taking your time with your shots, as you have far fewer with film), unloading it, and finally, developing it, there’s a lot of time that goes into far fewer shots. There’s something nice about that. Slowing down a bit. Focusing on what you’re doing to make sure your exposures are good and your image is in focus. The anticipation when waiting to get your film back from the lab. It all adds up to a much more interesting and exciting experience.\n“Time, cost, sometimes frustration, these all mean I am more intentional about taking photos…\nSummary # To sum up all those things into one overall reason that I love film: it is intentional. Time, cost, sometimes frustration, these all mean I am more intentional abut taking photos. It makes me slow down and think about what I’m doing, and I really like that. I have to do most things fast. I’m always trying to be more productive, more efficient, but film helps me get away from the hectic tendencies of day-to-day life. That’s part of why I’ve started using fountain pens, started writing by hand again, ride my bike more (when I’m not being lazy), etc. As the number of things I need to do each day goes up, I have to find joy and peace in doing those things. Film let’s me enjoy taking photos just a bit more.\nAnyways, I love photography. I love film. And I love sharing those things. Do you have anything that you love that might seem impractical? Do you love something, are fascinated by something? I hope so. It makes life just that much more enjoyable.\n","date":"June 7 2018","permalink":"/posts/film-photography/","section":"Posts","summary":"Why I got into photography # Of all the artistic mediums that I’ve tried, only one has stuck with me as something that I truly love: photography.","title":"Film Photography"},{"content":"Part 2: Installing Hugo # Intro # Alright, so you’re excited about creating your new website and you’re excited to give Hugo a try. Fair enough! Let’s jump right into it!\nA couple things to note, though, before we get started. If you are looking for the simplest and quickest way to get Hugo up and running, look no further than Hugo’s own docs. They are fairly easy to read, and are great if you’re just looking to get into it as quickly as possible. For me, quick start guide only got me so far, left me with a lot of questions, and didn’t actually work. My goal here is flesh out some of those questions, as well as provides answers for some of the issues I ran into, just in case someone else does.\nIt’s also worth noting that while I work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, I’ve only used Hugo on Linux, so that’s what you’ll see here. If you’ve got another OS, things shouldn’t be too different (depending on what you’ve got installed), and Google should be able to get you to where you need to go.\nInstallation # Installation with Hugo is (mostly) a breeze. Following the instructions on their quick start guide seems to work pretty well, with one caviat that I found-more on that later.\nThe terminal # To start off, open your terminal/console of choice. I use the built-in terminal that comes with Ubuntu, my Linux flavor of choice. Using the built-in terminal on macOS should work just as well, though I believe you need Homebrew installed. Windows users will want to follow the steps mentioned here. Once you’re in your console, make sure that you’re not in the wrong folder by typing:\n~$ cd Now, on Linux all you have to do is type:\n~$ sudo apt-get install hugo This should do it for Ubuntu/Debian users. Go ahead and follow the instructions in their docs if you’re using a different operating system.\nOnce complete, go ahead and type: hugo version to double check that the installation worked. It should show something like this:\nThe version problem # One of the issues I ran into with Hugo was with installation. Or rather, it was with installing a theme. That in itself is an easy enough task, but if you look at a theme here, you’ll see that on the left-hand side, it shows a minimum Hugo version. This is the minimum version of Hugo that you need installed in order to use that particular theme.\nThat’s all well and good, but installing Hugo by following the instructions in their docs should install the latest stable version, so that any theme can be used, right? Wrong. When I installed Hugo using the apt-get command, it installed version 0.16, or something like that. This only allowed me to use a small handful of themes, and there is no way to sort them by minimum version support.\nAfter some digging, I found that you can manually install the latest and greatest Hugo version by using the appropriate link from this page. This is pretty typical for installing stored on GitHub, but as someone who is fairly new to all of this, it was a bit confusing and frustrating.\nTo do this (again, on Ubuntu Linux), simply right-click the appropriate link, in my case the one that ends with Linux_64bit.deb, and put the following in a fresh console:\n~$ sudo wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.37.1/hugo_0.37.1_Linux-64bit.deb Obviously replace that long url with the one you just copied. By the way, if you’re like me, you’re probably wondering how to paste something into a terminal. Well, usually it’s ctrl+shift+v. Now that we’ve downloaded the newest release of Hugo, let’s unpack it using the following:\n~$ sudo dpkg -i hugo*.deb Now, running hugo version should return the version number that you just installed.\nIf you’re still not seeing the right version of Hugo, I recommend turning to the good people of the internet to help solve the issue, but if you’re on Linux, and you followed all the above steps, you shouldn’t really have any issues.\nCreating your site # Now it’s time to create your site. With Hugo, this is very, very easy. It actually only takes a single command. But before we do that, let’s make sure you’re putting that site where you want it!\nFolder structure # Create a folder where you want the site to be either in a finder/explorer window, or in your console. Either way, you’ll need to navigate to that folder in your console, so I find it’s easier to just mkdir there. If you’re new to the console and aren’t sure how to navigate, here’s a decent resource to get you started.\nKeep in mind that when you create your site, it will create it within a folder with the name of… well, whatever you name your site. So, if you’re making a blog site and you want it to be within your Documents/sites folder, just stay in the sites folder. No need to create one called blog.\nOnce you’re inside the folder you want to store the site in, we’ll use the following command:\nhugo new site blog Instead of blog, use whatever name you want to identify your site. This will create a new folder with all of the necessary files. So, if we type ls you should see your new site folder listed.\nThat’s it.\nPicking \u0026amp; installing a theme # For most themes, to install, you’re really just going to clone a GitHub repo into your themes folder. So, first things first, cd into your site folder. In my case that would be\ncd blog Now, go to the hugo themes site, and pick one. Remember how I made a big deal about how apt-get install hugo didn’t install the latest version? That’s because most of these themes will require a much later version of Hugo than what it initially installed.\nAnyways, pick a theme-I really like Kiss for a super simple blog-and click on the Download button.\nYou’ll want to look for the big green “Clone or Download” button on the themes GitHub page. Click that, and then copy the URL.\nNow go back to your console.\nFirst, we need to initialize Git in your site folder. It’s pretty simple, just git init. If you don’t have Git installed, go ahead and install it first. Then, we want to tell Git to clone and download the theme files into the appropriate folder. By telling it to put the theme in themes/kiss it will automatically create the folder for me.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/ribice/kiss.git themes/kiss Let it do its thing. It should look something like this.\nSetting the theme # Once that’s done, you’ve pretty much installed a theme. You’ll need to tell your site to use the theme, especially if you have multiple themes installed (which you can totally do). The first thing you’ll want to do is add the theme to your config.toml file. This is where a lot of basic information for your site will go. Being a .toml file, it’s a sort of database for Hugo to pull information from when it’s building your site later on. Once you’ve downloaded and decided on a theme, go ahead and add it to your config.toml file: theme = \u0026quot;themeName\u0026quot;.\nIf you’ve installed multiple themes, and you want to try some different ones, you can use -t to tell Hugo which theme to use when building your site. In a bit, we’ll go over how to view your site on Hugo’s built-in local server, which is a great way to view and try different themes locally.\nAdding some content # Right now, you’ve got a site with a theme, but nothing else. Let’s make a new blog post to test out how the site looks.\nhugo new posts/test.md This tells Hugo to create a new post called test.md. .md files are Markdown files. Markdown is a great way to quickly and easily write content for the web. It has it’s own, simple, syntax, and then Hugo will spit that out at HTML in your site files. It’s worth learning a bit of Markdown to make writing your posts easy (and honestly quite fun).\nGo ahead and open your new Markdown file in your favorite text editor. It will be in the posts folder within your site folder. The first thing you’ll see is a bit of metadata that Hugo automatically added to the top of the file. For now, let’s just leave that as-is.\nGo ahead and add some text underneath that metadata-after the second set of dashes-and then save the file.\nCongrats! You just added some content to your site!\nViewing the site locally using the Hugo server # Head back over to your console, and make sure that you’re in your site folder. If you’ve done everything the way I’ve described, you should already be there, but it never hurts to make sure. Whenever you’re working on your site, and you want to view it in the broswer locally, you’ll use the Hugo server. This is the built-in local server that comes with Hugo, and it makes it super easy to build and view your site with one simple command.\nhugo server That’s it.\nNow you can go to http://localhost:1313/ to view your site. However, if you left the metadata on your test.md file alone, you’re probably not seeing that post. That’s because Hugo creates a new post as a draft by default, and running the server normally will ignore drafts. To see your drafts as well, all you have to do is add -D after the server command. First, cancel the current instance of the server using ctrl+c. Then:\nhugo server -D Now you should be able to refresh the site and see your post! It will likely say “:Draft” after it, letting you know that it’s a draft.\nTo view your site with different themes, simply do like this:\nhugo server -t themeName Fun fact: Hugo server has an auto-refresh feature, so if you make a change to your posts while it’s running, your changes will appear as soon as you save the file. No need to refresh! It’s pretty great, but I have had instances when I needed to refresh the page a few times to see a bigger styling change or the like.\nGo Have Fun! # From here, go ahead and play around! If you want to do something specific with the site, Hugo’s own docs are a great resource, but there are plenty of people out there who know what they’re doing, and more than willing to help.\nHosting Your Hugo Site Online # Simply run the hugo command within in your site folder to build the site. This will create a folder called public, which contains all the normal site files in .html, .css, etc.\nThere are various ways to host a Hugo site. I personally host mine on GitHub Pages. I found this guide to be extremely helpful for getting that working (along with a lot of trial and error). You could upload files via ftp. Whatever you feel comfortable with.\nI hope that you’re finding as much joy in building with Hugo as I have. It’s allowed me to quickly, easily, and enjoyably build static websites, even on a busy schedule. I can’t wait to build something else!\n","date":"May 9 2018","permalink":"/posts/hugo-blog-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"Part 2: Installing Hugo # Intro # Alright, so you’re excited about creating your new website and you’re excited to give Hugo a try.","title":"Spinning Up a Hugo Blog - Part 2"},{"content":"Or, How I Made This Blog # I’ve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant.

In the past, any sites I’ve made have been made completely static using good ‘ol HTML \u0026amp; CSS. Somewhat recently, however, I had to get used to the idea of using WordPress for my new job. Not only did I discover that WordPress isn’t as terrible as I always imagined, it can be kind of fun! But that didn’t change my mind about using it for a blog-it’s just too heavy for something so simple.\nFor a while I thought my only options were to manually create, organize, and style my pages, or to use some sort of templating tool. A blog didn’t seem like it was worth the work of doing everything manually, and I was too lacking in web dev finesse to want to mess with template systems or the like.\nLearning about static site generators # I’ve been listening to The Shop Talk Show for a while now, and there was one episode where Dave Rupert was talking about this thing that could make static websites by just running a few commands in a console. This was well before I had spent much time in a console, but that sounded cool! It also sounded like exactly what I’d want to use for a simple blog. (Only) a couple of years later, and I decided to give it a try.\nIf you are a listener of that wonderful podcast, or you’ve spent more than a few months in the web dev community, you can probably guess what I’m talking about. It is, of course, Jekyll. If you didn’t know that, or don’t know much about it, Jekyll is what is called a static site generator. Basically, a static site generator is a program that uses a database to take a bunch of random (well, not really) files and smash them together into a fully functional website. Jekyll is likely the most well known and loved static site generator out there today.\nHowever, even Jekyll turned out to be more complicated than what I wanted. Jekyll is very, very cool, and is surprisingly good at scaling to different needs. And while there are certainly easier ways of getting a site up and running with Jekyll, I’ve found myself more and more enjoying my time in the console, and wanted to be able to do things quickly and easily there, without having to spend hours learning, installing dependencies, troubleshooting, etc.\nFinding Hugo # After a bit of searching around, I came across Hugo. Hugo is also a static site generator, but it’s a bit… lighter. After a bit of research this seemed like the perfect option for me and my new blog. It’s extremely easy to install, run, and works quite well with Github Pages, which is what I wanted to use to host my blog. Getting the blog live on Pages was far and away more difficult than building a site with Hugo, and you really only to set it up once to get things working. Now, all I really need to do is write a post using beautiful Markdown, and push to Github. That’s. It.\nSo, here we are, Hugo + Github Pages (and a custom domain) and I’ve got my ideal blogging solution that will allow me to expand a bit here and there as I go, without having to really worry about much else.\nPart 2 # Join me in Part 2 to see how to install and get started with Hugo.\n","date":"April 17 2018","permalink":"/posts/hugo-blog/","section":"Posts","summary":"Or, How I Made This Blog # I’ve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant.","title":"Spinning Up a Hugo Blog - Part 1"},{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s going on here? # I write about my interests. # As of right now, that is really about the gist of it! I’ve wanted to start a blog for a long time. However, I never really thought I had anything worth sharing. And, honestly, not much has changed. One thing that has changed, though, is my perspective on whether or not that matters. Turns out, it doesn’t. But something does…\nA confession # I have a confession: I hated writing papers in high-school. When I had to, I gave minimal effort, minimal interest, and didn’t think twice about the fact that I believed these papers were meaningless. This was largely my own fault. I’ve never been a terribly motivated person, and homework brought out this trait of mine doubly so.\nMy environment didn’t help all that much, though, either. I was never taught the joy of writing. I never witnessed that conveying something interesting or important to yourself or others through the written word can be enjoyable, satisfying, and rewarding.\nSo how and when did that part of me change? Probably in my sophomore year in college. I went to a general education college with a focus in graphic design. One of the required courses for all students was an English class. It turned out that the class largely focused on writing papers. I was not excited.\nBut what was different about that class from what I received in high-school? I’m quite positive I’ve figured out how to answer that question, and I’ll admit that it took me a while. I’m quite sure it all comes down to interest. Nothing in this world can quite feel meaningful or worthwhile without some amount of interest, whether that is in regards to something you are doing, making, reading, consuming, or writing.\nNow, when I started that class, I didn’t go into it with interest. No, I was going to treat this class like all of my other English courses. I was going to cruise through this class with minimal effort and a satisfactory grade. No, this time it all came down to my professor. Sure, he was passionate about writing, but I sure wasn’t, and no amount of kind words towards the activity were going to change my mind. However, what he did do differently than my past teachers, even if the topic I was writing about was absolutely ridiculous (\u0026quot;Is McDonald’s Really That Bad?\u0026quot;), was that he showed interest in my topics and my writing, despite my lack of it. He asked questions about how writing was going. He gave suggestions on where and how to research beyond the usual “go to the library”. He not only let me know what I was doing wrong when proofing my papers, but also remarked on things he found interesting about how I phrased something or a bit of research I found. He read into things that I didn’t even mean to be there, which made me interested in my own writing! Essentially, he made writing those papers feel worthwhile, because I found that someone, even myself sometimes, was actually getting something out of reading them.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve been craving that feeling ever since\u0026hellip; I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know it yet.\nMaking it happen # So here’s what I’m doing with this blog. I’m writing for the fun of it. I’m writing about my interests because that makes writing interesting. And rather than relying on a professor’s feedback to keep me motivated to keep writing, I think that my own interest will be enough to keep writing. And if you find any interest while reading what I write, well then that’s just icing on the cake, isn’t it?\n","date":"March 22 2018","permalink":"/posts/blog-intro/","section":"Posts","summary":"What\u0026rsquo;s going on here?","title":"Baby's First Blog Post"},{"content":"","date":"January 1 0001","permalink":"/work/","section":"","summary":"","title":"My Work History"}]
