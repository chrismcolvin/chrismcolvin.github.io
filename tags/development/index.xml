      <description>Part 2: Installing Hugo Intro Alright, so you’re excited about creating your new website and you’re excited to give Hugo a try. Fair enough! Let’s jump right into it!
A couple things to note, though, before we get started. If you are looking for the simplest and quickest way to get Hugo up and running, look no further than Hugo’s own docs. They are fairly easy to read, and are great if you’re just looking to get into it as quickly as possible.</description>

      <description>Or, How I Made This Blog I’ve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant. For one reason or another, I just didn’t feel like I should. This was of course silly, especially given the number of articles out there that make it clear, the best way to start a blog is to start one.
One of the main reasons I never started one was because I wanted to make a blog site that was custom, easy to use, and fast.</description>
