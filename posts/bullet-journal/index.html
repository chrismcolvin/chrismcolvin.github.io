<h2 id="trying-that-bullet-journal-thing">Trying That Bullet Journal Thing</h2>

<p>There is no question that we live in a time when having a handwritten planner is not the norm. In fact, for a long time, I thought my mother was simply wasting her time and money on a yearly planner, going through the process of keeping a physical planner is tedious and the cost of a planner is certainly more than the to-do app on your phone. These things are quicker and easier on a phone, computer, or tablet. Certainly, there is some merit to that argument, but after finding myself interested in fountain pens, I discovered something a bit different: the bullet journal. And this, I decided, was much more interesting than my mom&rsquo;s big old planner. So, I tried one!</p>

<p>First things first, maybe we should go over what exactly a bullet journal is. You may have heard the term before. Put simply, a bullet journal is a written planner that follows just a few simple rules in order to be quick to read, write, and organize. It&rsquo;s become a bit of a trend these days, and the idea even has it&rsquo;s own <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/">website</a>. There are quite a few guides out there at this point for how to organize a bullet journal, but I really think that everyone will, to some degree, have their own system. I&rsquo;ll be going over my own system, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+organize+a+bullet+journal&amp;oq=how+to+organize+a+bullet+journal&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.4066j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">looking into what others do</a>, to help you develop your own system and style.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/notebook-1.jpg" alt="small notebook with Kaweco Sport fountain pen" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping my journal in a very small pocket notebook, so I keep mine very, very simple. It&rsquo;s more of a glorified to-do list with a few other additions. First, I add a <em>key</em> at the very front of the notebook. Then, I leave a couple of blank pages to act as a sort of index. Basically, if I write a note on a page that I think I might need to refer to on a later date, I&rsquo;ll write the page number and a quick note about what the note is about. Then, I can quickly refer to writing ideas, thoughts about a day, etc.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/bullet-journal-3.jpg" alt="inside my bullet journal" /></p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s go back to that <em>key</em>. Mine consists of a few things. I try to keep it pretty simple, and use some of the symbols I found others using. Each symbol corresponds to a type of note. A · denotes a task that needs to be done. Once the task is completed, I simply put an X through the ·. A &gt; is a task that, for some reason or another, needs to get pushed to the next day-either because it didn&rsquo;t get done, or I&rsquo;m not planning on doing it today and don&rsquo;t want to forget about it tomorrow. Then, a &lt; refers to a task that was forwarded from the day before. Those last two symbols often get added to other symbols, so I may have certain symbols overlapping each other (ie. a task that got forwarded &lt; get&rsquo;s pushed forward again &gt;). This type of system can almost seem like <em>more</em> work than using a phone, but give it a week or two and things will start to click.</p>

<p>Here is my key to give you an idea of how I do things. Keep in mind this is my first journal, so I&rsquo;m sure it will become more refined over time.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/key-2.jpg" alt="bullet journal key" /></p>

<p>So what is day-to-day use like with a journal like this? Well, it&rsquo;s actually been great! I&rsquo;ll admit I was a bit skeptical starting out, especially being someone who&rsquo;s never used a journal or planner before. It only took me a few days to realize that I could use the journal in a way that would actually enrich my life, and not feel like a chore. keeping a bullet journal has made me more productive, motivated, and mindful with my time. If I think of something I need (or want) to do, I simply write it down. Using a pocket notebook means that it&rsquo;s with me wherever I go. As convenient as smart-phones are, I rarely actually put small tasks and notes in mine, and when I did, it almost felt like more work. Something about having them written down, also has made more likely to <em>actually</em> do those things. Writing things down is also, I&rsquo;ve found, enjoyable and a bit therapeutic.</p>

<p>Now, I do use a mix of digital and analog task keeping. Because I use such a small notebook for my journal, I don&rsquo;t have room for a monthly, or even weekly, schedule. So, most events and things that involve a schedule go into my phone. It&rsquo;s just better at that with reminders and such. Bur for small tasks, where I just need to remind myself to do or look at something I might forget, the bullet journal has been perfect. This may change, as <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/">I&rsquo;ve got my eye&rsquo;s on a more significant planner</a> to try after this notebook is full. It&rsquo;s also just enjoyable to do. Each morning (or sometimes evening) I open my journal and look over the day. If a task needs to be carried over, I carry it over. I add notes to my index if something requires it. I might even add a &ldquo;Bible verse of the day.&rdquo; It serves as a time for me to put aside all the distractions of the day and center myself for a moment. It&rsquo;s become one of the times I look forward to most each day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that a bullet journal is a great addition to my daily routine. Maybe it&rsquo;s something that could be a positive addition for you too. Or maybe not! It&rsquo;s definitely something you need to try before you really know, but I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>
