    <h1 class="title">The Fountain Pen Experiment /1</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by pens, pencils, and other mark-making tools. However, I&rsquo;ve never turned that interest into much more than a passing glance. Recently I finally decided to try something out that I&rsquo;ve been looking into for some time: the fountain pen.</p>

<p>Being a graphic-design student, I was certainly particular about my writing and drawing tools. I picked up a <a href="https://www.dickblick.com/products/koh-i-noor-kin-adapto-lead-holder/">lead holder</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sakura-Pigma-Micron-Pen-Black-6-Pen-Set/pd/21473">Micron pens</a>, both of which I still use and love, but neither of which were ever particularly great for note taking or writing for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve always been interested in getting a &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; pen. Something that I can call my own, that is unique, and that has a bit more personality than the cheap ballpoints I was using for actual writing. I also wanted something that would write smoothly, and that would encourage me to write more.</p>

<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t know much at the start, this actually led me to, well, ballpoints. There are some very nice ballpoint pens out there. In fact, <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Fisher-Space-Pen-Bullet-Ballpoint-Pen-Medium-Point-Matte-Black-Body/pd/7909">I&rsquo;ve got my eyes on one right now</a>. But then I came across fountain pens. I had always thought of fountain pens as old, impractical, and high maintenance. But the more I saw of them, the more I wanted one. Even <a href="https://www.relay.fm/penaddict">Myke Hurley was jumping on board</a>! Plus, they just look so cool!</p>

<p>So, after doing some research, the first thing that caught my attention was how &ldquo;normal&rdquo; they can seem to the people that use them. Sure, some people collect them, but most also use them, and a lot! I found high school and college students taking notes with them. I found people using them at work. I found people using them to sign checks, or fill their journals, or write a thoughtful letter. And they did all of this with something that other pens can&rsquo;t-at least not to the same degree-style and intention.</p>

<p>Above anything else, it was those two things that got me really intrigued. I rarely feel motivated to write, but I almost always want to. As silly as it sounds, I thought that a more intentional, personal, and stylish writing utensil might give me a little push to pick up that pen and just write. The fountain pen certainly seemed to fit the bill.</p>

<p>So I got one.</p>

<p>And it was really that easy. I just, got one. Sure I did a bit of research, but not much. I knew I wanted something I could throw in my pocket and one that would be easy to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; with as a newbie. But I didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> know what that meant in a fountain pen. As I sit here writing with my <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Classic-Sport-Fountain-Pen-Black-Medium-Nib/pd/3796">Kaweco Sport</a>, I guess I made a pretty good guess!</p>

<p><img src="/posts/kaweco_sport.jpg" alt="Kaweco Sport Fountain Pen on desk" /></p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend guessing, though, if you&rsquo;re thinking about getting your first fountain pen, as there are many factors that go into a fountain pen to be aware of. I won&rsquo;t go into detail here, but if you&rsquo;re reading this and are interested in these fine writing utensils, you&rsquo;ll want to at least Google around a bit. First, think about what you want in a pen, and then go from there.</p>

<p>There are many resources to look at in regards to fountain pens, so here&rsquo;s a short list of some of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.penaddict.com/">The Pen Addict</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/">JetPens</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/">Goulet Pens</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/">The Fountain Pen Network</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/">r/fountainpens</a></li>
<li>Google of course!</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways, thus begins my little experiment. So far, I love writing with my fountain pen, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sold on its practicality. It still feels very novel compared to a good ballpoint (the Fisher Space Pen even writes underwater!). I guess we&rsquo;ll see how I feel in time&hellip;</p>
