<p><img src="/posts/img/blog/pen paper coffee.jpeg" alt="a fountain pen resting on a notepad with coffee on a desk" /></p>

<p>As of right now, that is really about the gist of it! I&rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a long time. However, I never really thought I had anything worth sharing. And, honestly, not much has changed. One thing that has changed, though, is my perspective no whether or not that matters. Turns out, it doesn&rsquo;t. But something does&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<p>I have a confession: I hated writing papers in high-school. When I had to, I gave minimal effort, minimal interest, and didn&rsquo;t think twice about the fact that I believed these papers were meaningless. This was largely my own fault. I&rsquo;ve never been a terribly motivated person, and homework brought out this trait of mine doubly so.</p>

<p>My environment didn&rsquo;t help all that much, though, either. I was never taught the joy of writing. I never witnessed that conveying something interesting or important to yourself or others through the written word can be enjoyable, satisfying, and rewarding.</p>

<p>So how and when did that part of me change? Probably in my sophomore year in college. I went to a general education college with a focus in graphic design. One of the required courses for all students was an English class. It turned out that the class largely focused on writing papers. I was not excited.</p>

<p>But what was different about that class from what I received in high-school? I&rsquo;m quite positive I&rsquo;ve figured out how to answer that question, and I&rsquo;ll admit that it took me a while. I&rsquo;m quite sure it all comes down to <em>interest</em>. Nothing in this world can quite feel meaningful or worthwhile without some amount of interest, whether that is in regards to something you are doing, making, reading, consuming, or writing.</p>

<p>Now, when I started that class, I didn&rsquo;t go into it with interest. No, I was going to treat this class like <em>all</em> of my other English courses. I was going to cruise through this class with minimal effort and a satisfactory grade. No, this time it all came down to my professor. Sure, he was passionate about writing, but I sure wasn&rsquo;t, and no amount of kind words towards the activity were going to change my mind. However, what he did do differently than my past teachers, even if the topic I was writing about was absolutely ridiculous (&rdquo;<em>Is McDonald&rsquo;s Really That Bad?</em>&rdquo;), was that <strong>he showed interest in my topics <em>and</em> my writing, despite my lack of it</strong>. He asked questions about how writing was going. He gave suggestions on where and how to research beyond the usual &ldquo;go to the library&rdquo;. He not only let me know what I was doing wrong when proofing my papers, but also remarked on things he found <em>interesting</em> about how I phrased something or a bit of research I found. He read into things that I didn&rsquo;t even mean to be there, which made me <em>interested</em> in my own writing! Essentially, he made writing those papers feel worthwhile, because I found that someone, even myself sometimes, was actually getting something out of reading them.</p>

<p><strong>And I&rsquo;ve been craving that feeling since graduating in 2014.</strong></p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing with this blog. I&rsquo;m writing for the fun of it. I&rsquo;m writing about my interests because that makes writing interesting. And rather than relying on a professor&rsquo;s feedback to keep me motivated to keep writing, I think that my own interest will be enough to keep writing. And if you find any interest while reading what I write, well then that&rsquo;s just icing on the cake, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
