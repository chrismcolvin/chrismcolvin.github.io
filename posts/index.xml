      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by pens, pencils, and other mark-making tools. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve never turned that interest into much more than a passing glance. Recently I finally decided to try something out that I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into for some time: the fountain pen.
Being a graphic-design student, I was certainly particular about my writing and drawing tools. I picked up a lead holder, and Micron pens, both of which I still use and love, but neither of which were ever particularly great for note taking or writing for long periods of time.</description>
