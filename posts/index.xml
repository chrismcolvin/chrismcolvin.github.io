      <description>Trying That Bullet Journal Thing There is no question that we live in a time when having a handwritten planner is not the norm. In fact, for a long time, I thought my mother was simply wasting her time and money on a yearly planner, going through the process of keeping a physical planner is tedious and the cost of a planner is certainly more than the to-do app on your phone.</description>

      <description>Using the Pen It&amp;rsquo;s been about three or four weeks since I got my first fountain pen, a Kaweco Sport Classic, and I thought I would share some of my thoughts and experiences thus far. Below you&amp;rsquo;ll find a bit on what it&amp;rsquo;s like to use a fountain pen day-to-day.
First off, let&amp;rsquo;s go over what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my pen for. Being a pocket pen, this pen comes with me pretty much everywhere I go.</description>

      <description>Or, How I Made This Blog I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant. For one reason or another, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I should. This was of course silly, especially given the number of articles out there that make it clear, the best way to start a blog is to start one.
One of the main reasons I never started one was because I wanted to make a blog site that was custom, easy to use, and fast.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by pens, pencils, and other mark-making tools. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve never turned that interest into much more than a passing glance. Recently I finally decided to try something out that I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into for some time: the fountain pen.
Being a graphic-design student, I was certainly particular about my writing and drawing tools. I picked up a lead holder, and Micron pens, both of which I still use and love, but neither of which were ever particularly great for note taking or writing for long periods of time.</description>
