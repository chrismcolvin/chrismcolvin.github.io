      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Been a Minute. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read my post about setting new goals this spring, you might remember that one of my goals was to shoot more photos, and share those photos in ways I haven&amp;rsquo;t done before. One of the ways I thought of to share more photos is to create photo blog posts here on my personal blog. Basically, after I get a roll of film developed, or go on a little trip somewhere, or just go for a photo walk, I&amp;rsquo;ll post my findings here.</description>

      <description>Also, Taking and Sharing Photos, and Setting New Goals Spring is finally here. It took a hot secondâ€”2018 is turning out to be a bit of a trickster. But hey, I&amp;rsquo;m so happy that it&amp;rsquo;s starting to warm up, and the sun is shining. Rain will be wecome, too, to get things growing again.
A time of renewal and growth, Spring is a great time to set new goals. I&amp;rsquo;m not one to make new years resolutions, because I know I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t keep them.</description>

      <title>What is This Blog?</title>

      <description>I write about my interests. As of right now, that is really about the gist of it! I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a long time. However, I never really thought I had anything worth sharing. And, honestly, not much has changed. One thing that has changed, though, is my perspective no whether or not that matters. Turns out, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. But something does&amp;hellip;
I have a confession: I hated writing papers in high-school.</description>

      <title>The Fisher Space Pen</title>

      <description>The Fisher Space Pen is an interesting little pen. Smaller than my Kaweco Sport, it could literally fit anywhere. Which makes sense for an everyday carry inspired pen. After a recent rip to Seattle, I wanted a nice pen that was easy to travel with, and decided to pick one of these up. I thought I would share my thoughts for anyone else that might be thinking about picking on of these up as well.</description>

      <description>Part 2: Installing Hugo Intro Alright, so you&amp;rsquo;re excited about creating your new website and you&amp;rsquo;re excited to give Hugo a try. Fair enough! Let&amp;rsquo;s jump right into it!
A couple things to note, though, before we get started. If you are looking for the simplest and quickest way to get Hugo up and running, look no further than Hugo&amp;rsquo;s own docs. They are fairly easy to read, and are great if you&amp;rsquo;re just looking to get into it as quickly as possible.</description>

      <description>On Paper Lately at work I&amp;rsquo;ve been running into a bit of a predicament. You see, being a picket pen, I bring my Kaweco Sport with me every day. I&amp;rsquo;ve grown quite font of that little pen, and have started bringing it with me almost everywhere, along with my tiny little bullet journal. However, at work, I use these branded notepads to take notes on.
At first, I thought that the Kaweco was the issue.</description>

      <title>The Bullet Journal</title>

      <description>Trying That Bullet Journal Thing There is no question that we live in a time when having a handwritten planner is not the norm. In fact, for a long time, I thought my mother was simply wasting her time and money on a yearly planner, going through the process of keeping a physical planner is tedious and the cost of a planner is certainly more than the to-do app on your phone.</description>

      <description>Using the Pen It&amp;rsquo;s been about three or four weeks since I got my first fountain pen, a Kaweco Sport Classic, and I thought I would share some of my thoughts and experiences thus far. Below you&amp;rsquo;ll find a bit on what it&amp;rsquo;s like to use a fountain pen day-to-day.
First off, let&amp;rsquo;s go over what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my pen for. Being a pocket pen, this pen comes with me pretty much everywhere I go.</description>

      <description>Or, How I Made This Blog I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about creating a blog for a while now, but was always hesitant. For one reason or another, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I should. This was of course silly, especially given the number of articles out there that make it clear, the best way to start a blog is to start one.
One of the main reasons I never started one was because I wanted to make a blog site that was custom, easy to use, and fast.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by pens, pencils, and other mark-making tools. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve never turned that interest into much more than a passing glance. Recently I finally decided to try something out that I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into for some time: the fountain pen.
Being a graphic-design student, I was certainly particular about my writing and drawing tools. I picked up a lead holder, and Micron pens, both of which I still use and love, but neither of which were ever particularly great for note taking or writing for long periods of time.</description>
