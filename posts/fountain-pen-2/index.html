<h2 id="using-the-pen">Using the Pen</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been about three or four weeks since I got my first fountain pen, a Kaweco Sport Classic, and I thought I would share some of my thoughts and experiences thus far. Below you&rsquo;ll find a bit on what it&rsquo;s like to use a fountain pen day-to-day.</p>

<p>First off, let&rsquo;s go over what I&rsquo;ve been using my pen for. Being a pocket pen, this pen comes with me pretty much everywhere I go. That means I&rsquo;ve been bringing it with me to work nearly every day, and I&rsquo;ve used it to take notes from calls, keep track of my projects, or take notes during meetings. I&rsquo;ve also been using the pen to keep up a simple bullet journal. I&rsquo;l likely write a bit about the bullet journal sometime in the near future. As someone who never kept a journal growing up, it&rsquo;s been an interesting experiment, and have been pleasantly surprised with how useful and enjoyable it&rsquo;s been so far.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the pen. It&rsquo;s pretty awesome! There&rsquo;s really no writing experience quite like writing with a fountain pen. Even with pretty significant &ldquo;<a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2014/4/23/smooth-as-a-babys-bottom-or-not">baby&rsquo;s bottom</a>&rdquo; the Kaweco writes so much nicer than any ballpoint or gel ink pen I&rsquo;ve used.</p>

<p>This does not mean, however, that using a fountain pen as a daily driver (writer?) doesn&rsquo;t have its cons. In fact, if having to think about the pen you&rsquo;re writing with sounds like a pain to you, then I would not recommend using one as a daily driver.</p>

<p>For one, at least due to the nib of my particular pen, hard starts-getting ink flowing after not using the pen for a while-can get very annoying, particularly when in a meeting or on a phone call where time is limited. If you frequently need to get up and writing quickly and without warning, then a fountain pen might not be the best option for your needs. If you do choose to get one, though, then at least look for one with a quality nib that you won&rsquo;t need to fiddle with each time.</p>

<p>Along those lines, the Kaweco Sport has a screw-on type cap. This is very helpful being a pocket pen, as it means there&rsquo;s less chance of anything getting in my clothing if a leak occurs (which hasn&rsquo;t happened so far). Because a fountain pen dries out if it is not used and the cap is left off, that means I am screwing the cap on and off frequently throughout the day. For quick notes or phone calls, this can get tedious and the time really adds up.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about maintenance. One of the main reasons many people shy away from fountain pens is due to the extra maintenance required over a simple ballpoint. A fountain pen needs to be well maintained to keep writing in that smooth, pleasant manner you expect. This mean regular cleaning. So far, for my pen, I simply clean the pen with tap water whenever it&rsquo;s time for new ink. There are plenty of videos out there about how to clean your particular fountain pen, and it really only takes a few minutes to get a pen pretty clean. Given the simplicity and frequency at which a pen really needs cleaning, it hasn&rsquo;t been an issue whatsoever.</p>

<p>Another important thing to note is adding ink to the pen. For now, I&rsquo;m using cartridges, which get the pen up and running in no time, but I did purchase a converter, and will be trying that out soon. That has the potential to be much messier.</p>

<p>Taking care of the nib of your pen is also very important, as a lot can go wrong with it, and if it&rsquo;s not just right, the writing experience suffers greatly. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-fountain-pen-nibs-troubleshooting-tips-and-tricks/pt/777">JetPens has some great info on nibs</a>. Though, if something ever happens to mine, I may just send it in and pay a professional to get it just right.</p>

<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how things are going. And I can say that getting a fountain pen has motivated me to do exactly what I was hoping it would: write. Because these pens <em>should</em> be used daily, it is helping me to at least put that pen to paper once a day. After all, I did write this post using my new favorite pen as well.</p>
