# My Top Ten Podcasts for 2021

Podcasts have exploded in the last few years, and I have no doubt that 2021 will be just the same. Spend a few hours listening to a great podcast and the reason for this becomes quite clear. Podcasts are an amazing, but simple, way of telling a story, catching up on industry news, or exploring a new hobby.

With thousands of fantastic podcasts to choose from made by talented people with something to share it can be difficult to know where to begin. My advice is always to consider what you might want in a podcast and then search around for the what people are recommending in that category. Looking for top notch storytelling with a spooky twist? Search for horror podcasts. Looking for deep dives into current events? There are plenty. Want to learn more about gardening? There are hundreds.

The important idea here is that with so many out there, part of the fun is exploring the different ideas and genres out there and finding the podcasts you really enjoy. With that, I wanted to share the ten podcasts I am most looking forward to listening to more of in 2021.

## 10. Bananas
> Kurt Braunohler and Scotty Landes discuss the strange, fascinating, and just plain bananas news from around the world.

This is a podcast in which you truly never know what you are going to hear. Kurt and Scotty pull unexpected news from any and all sources from the time a criminal tried to escape using an underwater sea scooter to a man dressed as a cow stealing milk from Walmart. It can be a wild ride that is simultaneously fascinating, hilarious, and horrifying. 

If you think you will enjoy podcasts that poke fun at the extraordinary but hidden events happening every day, then this is a great place to start.

## 9. The Candid Frame
> Each week host Ibarionex Parello brings in-depth, intimate and thoughtful conversations with photographers on living a photographic life.

If you are at all interested in photography, let the deep, soothing voice of Ibarionex take you away as he makes conversation with some of the worlds best photographers. Starring amazing guests from portrait photographers that shoot the worlds biggest celebrities to world-renowned fine art and landscape photographers, there is no shortage of amazing conversation and story in this podcast. 

In The Candid Frame, Ibarionex gets personal with his guests, delving deeper into their stories, backgrounds, and  philosophies. While respectful, he challenges them to discuss the tougher aspects of their art or career, often revealing some the more human aspects of these fantastic artists. If you've ever wondered what some of the best photographers of today, or yesteryear, are really like or how they got to where they are, this is the podcast for you.

Oh yeah, and did I mention his voice?

## 8. Film Photography Podcast
> Topics will touch on all film formats...

Another photography podcast, this one focuses solely on film photography and videography. I picked up film photography in college and still use my grandfather's old Canon AE-1 regularly.

This podcast features a unique sound editing style that offers plenty of entertainment and information. There are frequently guests on the podcast, conversations about unique cameras, and even throwbacks of old commercials from Kodak, Fujifilm, or the like.

If you have ever dabbled in or are interested in dabbling in film photography, this is a must-listen.

## 7. Sawbones: A Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine
> Join Dr. Sydnee McElroy and her husband Justin McElroy for a tour of all the dumb, bad, gross, weird, and wrong ways we've tried to fix people.

Ever wonder what the miracle healing drinks of yesteryear were and how they came to be, or about the medical virtues of coffee? Sydnee and Justin explore topics like these and much more in Sawbones. This is a podcast that I truly always look forward to, as the conversation is always either relevant to current events or just immensely interesting.

Sydnee brings the expertise while Justin brings the humor (anyone who has listened to the ever-popular My Brother My Brother and Me will know the name). The couple brings a fantastic and often very funny dynamic to all sorts of medical-related topics. Surely this must be one of the only podcasts to combine this level of historical medical research with this level of humor.

## 6. Lore
> Lore is a bi-weekly podcast about dark historical tales.

If you like stories about the supernatural and spooky experiences of real-life people throughout history, look no further than Lore. Host Aaron Mahnke has the unique ability to instill within the listener an uneasy doubt about their own realities. Aaron does not attempt to explain away the experiences of the characters in the stories he shares, but rather uses them as a platform to explore the human psyche and the often devastating effects it can have on our realities.

Before jumping into his latest episodes, I recommend listening to episode 23: Rope and Railing, which serves as a great introduction to the type of stories you can expect.
